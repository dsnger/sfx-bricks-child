# Release Process Rules

## Before Making Any Release

### 1. **Ask for Permission**
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before making a release
- Only proceed with release **on demand** from the user
- Never automatically create releases

### 2. **Check Changelog and Version**
- Verify `style.css` version is updated for the latest changes
- Verify `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry for the current version
- If either is missing, update them first:
  - Update version in `style.css`
  - Add changelog entry with proper format and details

### 3. **Check Git Status**
- Verify all changes are committed to git
- If uncommitted changes exist, commit them first:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "vX.X.X: [description of changes]"`
  - `git push`

### 4. **Release Process Checklist**
After user approval, follow this order:
1. ✅ Confirm changelog and version are updated
2. ✅ Confirm all changes are committed and pushed
3. ✅ Build theme: `./build-theme.sh`
4. ✅ Create git tag: `git tag vX.X.X`
5. ✅ Push tag: `git push origin vX.X.X`
6. ✅ Create GitHub release with zip file
7. ✅ Clean up local zip file

### 5. **Never Skip Steps**
- Always follow the checklist in order
- Never assume anything is already done
- Always verify each step before proceeding to the next

### 6. **User Communication**
- Keep user informed of each step
- Report any issues immediately
- Confirm completion of release process
