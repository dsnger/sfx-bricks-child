**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Don't guess

Applies to factual claims in every answer, not only implementation. Confidence is not evidence.

**Leave gaps visible.** Do not invent missing or ambiguous facts. State what is unknown and why. In extraction
tasks, leave unsupported fields blank where the format permits; otherwise use the format's defined missing-value
handling.

**Separate evidence from inference.** Cite the relevant source for factual conclusions. Identify deductions and
assumptions as such, with their basis. For extraction tasks, label populated fields EXTRACTED or INFERRED and
explain each inference where the required output format permits. If neither annotations nor accompanying
explanations are permitted, preserve the required format. This does not permit inventing unsupported values.

**Keep decisions distinct from facts.** Make reasonable design and implementation choices within the authorized
scope, describing them as choices rather than source facts. Ask when missing information changes correctness or
scope.

**Verify before claiming.** Report a test or action as completed only when its result was observed. Preserve
required output formats; put explanations outside structured artifacts where permitted.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

Ground progress claims: before reporting a step as done, audit the claim against a tool result from this session ("tests green" needs a test run to point to). Report unverified work as unverified — this keeps status reports factual on long runs.

The work loop includes the review gates: **spec ready → Gate A (spec) → Gate-A closing act → plan ready → Gate A (plan) → Gate-A closing act → execute → tests green → Gate B → Gate-B closing act** (see §5, which states when each act may be performed and what it is).

### Spec, plan and code — what each decides

- **Spec:** intended behaviour and scope; boundaries and shared contracts; significant architecture and security decisions; acceptance criteria. Internal implementation stays open where those commitments permit.
- **Plan**, per meaningful step: the outcome; affected components and existing implementation to reuse; prerequisites, order and the decisions that must already be settled; concrete test situations with expected outcomes, including relevant failures; the implementer's remaining decision space. The plan also names its handover boundary and carries a short **Sources and impact boundary** note.
- **Code:** function bodies, complete tests and routine local choices. A short algorithm sketch or a bounded feasibility probe belongs in a plan only where it resolves a named uncertainty.

Why: code written into a plan is written and reviewed twice, and a plan review then spends its passes on that code instead of on missing decisions.

Where `superpowers:writing-plans` asks for code blocks in every code step, complete test code, or repeated code instead of a reference to an earlier step, this section governs: user instructions outrank skills.

**Local choices.** Decide locally within approved commitments. A change to an approved commitment about product behaviour, a shared contract, a security guarantee or scope goes through the decision and amendment route; implementing approved behaviour does not. Why: review settled the commitments, not every line that realises them.

**Context, by task.** Read the applicable binding instructions, the current task and its approved artifacts, and what this kind of task needs — a dependency change: the tech-stack description and the affected manifests; an interface change: its contracts and their users — plus the relevant components, dependencies, configuration, realistic data volumes and target environments. Read further while a material uncertainty or a possible impact stays open. Load a historical record when you need it to understand a decision, constraint or open obligation; following one link does not mean loading everything it links to. Binding reading duties stay until changed through their route, and calling a document "reference" does not make its binding conditions optional. Note the sources and the impact boundary in the plan, or in the task's existing work record when there is no plan. Why: reading by task keeps context small without dropping a binding condition, and the note lets a reviewer see what was and was not looked at.

**Splitting.** Before a large spec, check whether the work holds independently reviewable outcomes with identifiable shared contracts. Touching several features is a reason to examine the scope, not by itself to split. File size is a warning signal, not a limit. Why: a split decided by size alone separates what belongs together.

**Fresh session at a completed unit.** The plan names its handover boundary: normally the completed story or an independently executable sub-plan; a closed review cycle may be chosen as an earlier one; never inside a running cycle. At the boundary, write the handover and stop; the next unit starts in a fresh session, started by the human unless an approved mechanism for it exists. The handover is a current summary: verified state and next task; every open obligation and unresolved decision, including any still recorded only in an earlier state; authoritative artifact and evidence paths; review-cycle identity and status. It links earlier states instead of appending full status reports. Use the project's existing handover file, otherwise `.context/handover-<unit>.md`, one per unit; that is enough when the next unit continues in the same checkout. When the next checkout is another one or not yet known, save the compact handover — summary, open obligations, the source paths needed to continue — in the tracked location the project designates for handovers, and before continuing confirm it is present in the target checkout; a local commit alone does not make it so. This creates no obligation to publish session logs or the rest of `.context/`. An interrupted review cycle follows the resume rules in §5, not this paragraph. Why: a long session carries context the next unit does not need, and a summary that carries every obligation lets the fresh session lose none.

## 5. Cross-Model Review (Codex) — TWO MANDATORY GATES

**The full rules live in `.claude/review-gates.md`. Read that file in full before any
work it governs: any Gate A or Gate B pass, resuming or closing a cycle, any commit,
preparing a merge, and deciding a change needs no gate.** Every reference to §5 (its
Mechanics, Profiles, closure ordering or gate prompt) means that file.

**It is longer than one read returns.** Read it in parts, each starting where the last one
stopped, until you have seen its last line. A search finds a passage; it does not tell you
what the rest of the rules require.

**If that file is missing, this project has no gate rules.** Stop before any work they
govern, and restore it: `/workflow-init` writes it.

Why it is separate: inline, the rules push the instruction files past Claude Code's size
limit.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
