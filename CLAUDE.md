**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

Ground progress claims: before reporting a step as done, audit the claim against a tool result from this session ("tests green" needs a test run to point to). Report unverified work as unverified — this keeps status reports factual on long runs.

The work loop includes the review gates: **spec ready → Gate A (spec) → plan ready → Gate A (plan) → execute → tests green → Gate B → commit** (see §5).

## 5. Cross-Model Review (Codex) — TWO MANDATORY GATES

**The full rules live in `.claude/review-gates.md`. Read that file in full before any
work it governs: any Gate A or Gate B pass, resuming or closing a cycle, any commit,
preparing a merge, and deciding a change needs no gate.** Every reference to §5 (its
Mechanics, Profiles, closure ordering or gate prompt) means that file.

**It is longer than one read returns.** Read it in parts, each starting where the last one
stopped, until you have seen its last line. A search finds a passage; it does not tell you
what the rest of the rules require.

**If that file is missing, this project has no gate rules.** Stop before any work they
govern, and restore it: `/workflow-init` writes it.

Why it is separate: inline, the rules push the instruction files past Claude Code's size
limit.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

Project architecture, stack-specific patterns, and invariants live in @AGENTS.md
(single source of truth — also read directly by Codex and the PR review bots). The
Cross-Model Review gates (§5) check against the invariants there.
