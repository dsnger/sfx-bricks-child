**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

Ground progress claims: before reporting a step as done, audit the claim against a tool result from this session ("tests green" needs a test run to point to). Report unverified work as unverified — this keeps status reports factual on long runs.

The work loop includes the review gates: **spec ready → Gate A (spec) → plan ready → Gate A (plan) → execute → tests green → Gate B → commit** (see §5).

## 5. Cross-Model Review (Codex) — TWO MANDATORY GATES

Independent second opinion at two gates. Easiest steps to skip, so the discipline is
yours — a non-blocking hook (shipped by the `dev-workflow` plugin) reminds you at
each. Opt out per-workspace with `.context/codex-gate.off` (delete to re-enable); the
gates still apply. The hook counts passes by TOOL NAME (`mcp__codex__exec` /
`mcp__codex__review`) and by RESULT ENVELOPE — it withholds the count for a routed gate
call whose result it reads as failed, backgrounded, or yielding no usable text. If your
Codex MCP server names its tools differently, map it in `.context/codex-gate.tools`
(`execTool=<name>` / `reviewTool=<name>`) — otherwise your reviews are invisible to the
counters and Gate B reports "not run" forever. A mapped name must itself start with
`mcp__codex__`, or it is refused — outside that namespace it is either never delivered
to the hook or, for `Bash`/`Skill`, hijacks a lifecycle event. Register the server as
`codex` to place its tools there.

**Both gates are a LOOP with a HARD FLOOR: min 3 passes per run (Blocker/Major
only), counted by the hook.** The hook counts passes but can't read findings or
tell the spec run from the plan run (it resets at `writing-plans`), so Gate A —
the spec run especially — is instruction-backed: a satisfied count is not a clean
review. Open a TodoWrite "Codex pass N" per pass; fix Blocker/Major after each. Your
final pass must be clean — if pass 3 still finds Blocker/Major, keep going until
clean or clearly stuck → then STOP and surface to the user. The only early exit
below 3 is a pass with **zero** findings; don't manufacture findings to pad. Codex is
advisory — validate before applying; dismissed finding → one-line why.

**Findings go to a FILE, not the response — both gates.** Long finding lists come back
cut off, and a cut that lands between findings is indistinguishable from a short list:
silently dropped findings, the dangerous direction. Claude Code both limits MCP tool
output (25,000 tokens by default, `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`) and persists over-threshold
results to disk behind a file reference; the protocol below is correct under either,
because the response stops carrying the findings at all. Append to the gate prompt:

> Pass the reviewed repo root as `workingDirectory`. Write the FULL findings list to
> `.context/codex-reviews/<slot>.md` (create the directory if needed; the path is
> relative to that root — Codex resolves writes against its working directory, so
> without this a valid file can land in a different checkout). `<slot>` is
> `gate-a-spec-pass-<p>`, `gate-a-plan-pass-<p>`, or `gate-b-<spec|quality>-pass-<p>`.
>
> One finding per line, in exactly this six-field format — escape a literal pipe
> inside a field as `\|`:
>
> `SEVERITY | confidence | location | what is wrong | why it matters | suggested fix`
> Severity is one of exactly: BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | NIT — no other token.
> Every line before the terminator is exactly one finding line — no blank lines,
> headings, prose or wrapped continuations. End the file with a final line reading
> exactly `END OF FINDINGS (<n> total)`, `<n>` being the number of finding lines. A
> clean pass is the single body line `NO FINDINGS` with `END OF FINDINGS (0 total)`.
>
> Then reply with ONLY one line per branch — `<gate> | pass <p> | <n> findings | <path>`
> — or `INCOMPLETE | <cause> | <path>` if you could not write the file. An unwritten
> file behind a normal-looking reply is the one outcome the reader cannot diagnose.

**Gate B takes one file per branch** because `reviewType: full` runs the spec and
quality reviewers in parallel from one `additionalContext`. Aimed at a single path they
race, and the second writer leaves a correctly terminated, correctly counted file
holding half the findings — with every check still passing.

**Before each call, delete every target file and confirm it is gone.** A call that dies
part-way leaves the prior attempt's valid file behind, and no terminator can tell that
from a fresh one. If a target survives deletion, stop and name the cause — path resolved
against the wrong root, permissions, a *directory* at the target, or a file reappearing
(another writer) each need a different fix, and "delete failed" alone sends you retrying
the delete. Run one pass at a time: the slot name has no invocation-unique component, so
two concurrent calls on one slot race. Passes are sequential by construction, so that is
a stated limitation, not a guarded one.

**Optional companions, from field practice.** Two files may sit beside a findings file.
Both are advisory human notes: neither is ever the findings file, neither participates in
pass validation, and either may be deleted or rebuilt. The findings file plus its
terminator remain the only hard requirement, and a zero-finding pass needs no companion.

- `<slot>-dispositions.md` — one line per finding: verdict + reason. It makes a dismissal
  durable, so "we looked at that and why" outlives the session rather than the chat.
- a **cycle-stable** resume note when a cycle is interrupted — `gate-a-spec-resume.md`,
  `gate-a-plan-resume.md`, `gate-b-resume.md`. Cycle-stable, not pass-named: a note keyed
  to the interrupted pass number is exactly the file a resuming agent will not look for
  once the counter moves or an incomplete pass is discounted. Gate A runs separate spec
  and plan loops, so those are two cycles; Gate B is one cycle with one note even under
  `reviewType: full`, because the per-branch findings files race only since Codex's two
  reviewers write them — the resume note is written by the outer agent, sequentially, and
  splitting it would create two records able to disagree about one shared recovery budget.
  Whoever runs the cycle writes it when useful, replaces it as the cycle moves, and
  deletes it once the cycle closes. Nothing depends on it existing.


**Accept a pass only when** the file exists and is readable; its last line is exactly
`END OF FINDINGS (<n> total)`; it contains exactly `<n>` finding lines *and nothing
else* (or the single line `NO FINDINGS` when `<n>` is 0 — "n valid lines somewhere in
the file" would accept a truncated file padded with fragments); and, for a `full` Gate-B
pass, both branch files satisfy all of that. Anything else — missing, unreadable or
empty file, wrong path, malformed terminator, count mismatch, extra lines, one branch
file, an `INCOMPLETE` reply — is an **INCOMPLETE pass**, which is not a review: don't
act on the partial list, don't count it toward the 3-pass floor, and don't read "no
Blocker/Major visible" as clean.

**Reader:** the severity field is taken by splitting the line on **unescaped** pipes and
trimming the ASCII whitespace the finding format puts either side of each separator; a field
that is empty or all whitespace is a **structural** failure, so the line is INCOMPLETE and is
never normalized. Otherwise the field is matched **case-insensitively** against the four tokens
first — `Minor`, `minor` and `MINOR` are all `MINOR`, because `CLAUDE.md` Mechanics
legitimately spells them in Title case and a model copying that spelling is doing as it was
told, not drifting. A field that matches no token case-insensitively, and is non-empty, is
read as `MAJOR`. Every **structural** failure stays INCOMPLETE — a malformed
line, a wrong field count, an empty severity field, a bad terminator, a count mismatch. Only
the severity token is tolerated, and only when everything else about the line is right.
(PR #23's Gate-B pass 3 returned all four findings at `IMPORTANT`; discarding that pass over a
token would have thrown away four real findings.)

**Recovery: one attempt per pass**, shared across timeout, an `INCOMPLETE` reply and
failed validation — the Mechanics timeout-retry rule widened, not a second budget beside
it, since two budgets let a pass alternate between them indefinitely. The attempt is a
fresh re-run, deleting exactly what it will rewrite: both branch files for a full
re-run, only the failed branch for a single-branch resume — deleting both and recreating
one makes the both-files check fail by construction, spending the attempt on a path that
cannot succeed. Prefer a resume only when the reply shows the review ran and just the
write failed: pass the `sessionId` from the original tool result back, and for a Gate-B
branch pass its `reviewType` alongside (`spec` with `specSessionId`, `quality` with
`qualitySessionId`) — the tool defaults to `full`, and a resume that omits it can run the
other reviewer and write the wrong slot, which no check detects, because the file is
well-formed and merely from the wrong branch. Whether a resumed session re-executes the
write or just returns its prior summary is not established; if it returns the summary,
that was the attempt. Spent and still incomplete → STOP and surface, naming which check
failed.

**What this does not do.** The hook counts on `PostToolUse`, keyed on tool name **and on
the result envelope**, and still never sees the file. Claude Code fires `PostToolUse`
after a *successful* call and routes a failed one to `PostToolUseFailure`, which the
plugin registers no handler for — but do not infer from that which failures escape
counting: the pinned `mcp-codex-dev` catches its own errors, executor timeouts and aborts
included, and returns them as a normal result carrying `success: false` rather than
throwing or setting `isError`. A failed review therefore still looks like a successful
*tool call* — but as of 0.8.0 the hook reads the result of gate calls it can route, and
withholds the count for three **recognized** shapes: an envelope whose **first** property
is `success: false`, the harness backgrounding notice **in the wording it currently
uses**, and a result from which no usable text can be obtained. Every other routed gate
call counts, including any located text the hook cannot interpret — a reordered envelope,
a reworded notice, an unknown third-party shape — which counts **with** a disclosure that
is attempted and normally shown once per workspace, but can be lost or repeated when its
marker cannot be persisted. So does a call that returns and then fails validation. The
counter is therefore closer to the truth than it was and is still not evidence: a
"satisfied" count can still overstate the passes you actually hold, and reasoning about
which failure took which event path will get it wrong. The rule that follows is the
simple one: **discount every incomplete pass regardless of what the counter says**,
because classification cannot see whether the findings file was written.
Nothing checks the terminator mechanically; this is
instruction-backed by design, and a recurring truncation incident is the trigger to build
the checker, not a reason to build it now. Detection is conditional: it catches an absent
or malformed terminator, a count mismatch and a missing branch file *in the artifact you
actually read*; it does not catch a model that writes a wrong count with a matching
number of lines, nor a stale file if you skip the delete.

**Why `.context/codex-reviews/`:** the hook excludes `.context/` from all three of its
fingerprint components, so review artifacts cannot invalidate the review they document.
Add `/.context/codex-reviews/` to `.gitignore` — that entry specifically, not all of
`.context/`, which would strip the committed `codex-gate.on` adoption marker.

- **Gate A — Spec, then plan (TWO runs, each its own 3-pass loop).** Run on the
  **spec** right after brainstorming (before `writing-plans`), then on the
  **plan** before `executing-plans`/`subagent-driven-development` — catching a
  spec flaw before it's baked into the plan. Tool: `mcp__codex__exec` (raw;
  reviews the TEXT you pass, not the git tree). Use ONE broad prompt, re-run it
  each pass over the revised artifact (don't narrow per-dimension; new findings
  surface because the artifact changes between passes). The prompt MUST open with
  *"Use the superpowers:brainstorming skill to review this spec,"* (say "plan" on
  the plan run), then ask Codex to check it against our settled decisions and
  surface **contradictions/inconsistencies, missing requirements, unhandled
  state/edge/error/empty/concurrent paths, and risks to the Key Invariants
  (@AGENTS.md) — plus anything else** (coverage floor, not a cage). Append the
  intent + artifact text + which invariants it touches. Ask for **every** finding
  with severity and confidence — you filter to Blocker/Major downstream, Codex
  never does, because a model told to report only high severity drops real
  findings silently. Ask for one line per finding and a literal `NO FINDINGS`
  when a pass is clean — the explicit clean signal is what lets you exit the loop:

  ```
  MAJOR | high | §3 "Retry policy" | retry count unbounded | a poisoned job loops forever | cap at 5, then dead-letter
  NO FINDINGS
  ```

  Each pass: validate, revise, re-run. Before each read pass, settle mechanically what the
  artifact asserts and a machine can decide without side effects — cited paths, quoted
  passages, stated counts, the syntax of standalone fenced blocks — because a read pass
  spends expensive judgement on what a parser settles in seconds and misses it anyway,
  inspecting quoted commands rather than running them, since a command quoted in a spec
  may be destructive or an intentional failure. (Large/high-risk artifact: optional focused
  per-dimension passes on top.)
- **Gate B — Code.** Tests green, before `git commit`. Tool: `mcp__codex__review`
  (args `instruction`, `whatWasImplemented`, `baseSha`; `reviewType: full` runs
  spec + quality in parallel). Skip ONLY trivial changes. Check against
  @AGENTS.md. Re-review after every fix — a fix changes the diff and the hook
  invalidates the prior pass, which is where the 3 come from.

  **A fix that changes specified behaviour updates the spec in the same commit.** If a
  Gate-B fix alters something the approved spec pins down — an ordering, a terminal
  state, a contract — the spec is stale the moment you commit, and the next reader
  trusts it. Update both, and let the re-review cover both. This is not hypothetical:
  a Gate-B fix here reordered a precedence rule and added a terminal state, the spec
  was left describing the old behaviour, and a PR bot found the disagreement after
  merge-readiness. Neither gate caught it *in that run*: Gate A had already passed the
  spec before the fix existed, and the Gate-B call was given only the diff. A reviewer
  handed both artifacts could catch it — which is why this is a rule about what you
  commit, not a claim about what the gates detect.

  Same coverage rule as Gate A: put "report every finding with severity and confidence; say
  `NO FINDINGS` if clean" in `additionalContext`, with the same one-line format.

  **Standing lens, every Gate-B call: "which existing statements does this diff falsify?"**
  A change makes sentences wrong in files it never touches. Checks scoped to the edited
  paths — a parity diff, a resync, a grep of your own edits — do not look there, because
  the file was correct until your change landed elsewhere. This lens is prompt text: it
  asks, nothing enforces the ask or validates the answer, and no comprehensive check
  covers arbitrary semantic drift. Ask anyway; in practice it is what surfaces them.
  **Name what this diff changes the size, value or position of** — a list, a count, a
  version, an identifier, a cited line — and grep for where each is described elsewhere,
  because asked as an open question alone this lens missed three such statements in one
  cycle while being carried with unusual force.

  **What counts as prose (the only Gate-B exemption).** Every staged path is
  explanatory documentation — `docs/**.md`, `README.md` → N/A. Those describe the
  product rather than being it, so they carry no gate at all. **Prompts are not
  prose:** `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and anything under a `.claude/`, `plugins/`,
  `skills/` or `commands/` directory **at any depth**, are product even though they
  are `.md` — all fire full Gate B, as does any mixed commit or any non-`.md` file.
  Agent definitions are covered by that list, not listed separately: they live in
  `.claude/agents/` or `plugins/*/agents/`, both already matched. A bare top-level
  `agents/` is not matched, so do not add one and assume the gate sees it.
  The hook classifies paths the same way. Those directory names match at any depth
  deliberately, so a root-level `skills/` and a monorepo's `packages/*/.claude/` are
  both covered; the cost is that prose under a same-named directory
  (`docs/commands/reference.md`) fires too — a redundant reminder, never a missed
  review.

### Profiles — how much review this story gets

A story may carry a profile in its header: `**Risk:**` (`trivial|standard|high`),
`**Security:**` (`none|standard|high`), and a `**Validation:**` mode derived from them
(`battery` / `battery+check` / `battery+check+verification`, plus `+abuse-path` when and
only when security is `high`). The **story header is the single writable copy** — specs,
plans, commit bodies and this file's prompts carry the story **path** and read the values
fresh at each pass, never a remembered or copied value.

**The axes steer the questions; the mode steers the evidence.** Separate levers: one aims
the reviewer, the other obliges the author.

**Lens sets, appended to the gate prompt:**
- **risk `high`** → threats, abuse, rollback, data loss, idempotency, compatibility,
  observability.
- **security `standard` or `high`** → assets, trust boundaries, roles, external systems,
  abuse paths.
- **both** → the union appended **once**, each lens labelled with the axis that motivated
  it; risk's *abuse* and security's *abuse paths* are **one lens carrying both labels**,
  not two questions.

Lenses are **different questions, not more passes.** The 3-pass floor, the Blocker/Major
filter, the file-first findings protocol and the clean-final-pass rule are unchanged.

**Reading the profile — three cases, three answers:**
1. The artifact **cites no story** → run unprofiled and **say so** in the pass. Artifacts
   predating this rule are the common case; stopping on them would halt in-flight work.
2. The cited story has **no profile line** → same: today's behaviour.
3. A profile is **present but unresolvable** → **stop and surface the cause**. That covers
   the syntactic failures — unparseable line, a value outside the enums, two profile
   blocks, a citation resolving to nothing — **and the semantic ones**: a `**Validation:**`
   value disagreeing with `max(risk, security)`, or `+abuse-path` present without security
   `high` or absent with it. Only the **latest `mode override`** in the log, moving in a
   direction compatible with the current value, can explain such a mismatch — and if the
   log also contains an `axis change`, only when that override was recorded **after** the
   latest one, since an axis change voids every prior override. A log with no `axis
   change` at all is the ordinary intake-time override, and its entry resolves the
   mismatch on its own. A well-formed value can still be the wrong value, and a stale mode steers
   weaker evidence while looking entirely valid; recomputing it is a profile change like
   any other — proposed, human-confirmed, logged. Falling back to the lighter behaviour on
   a malformed profile would under-review exactly the stories most likely to have one.

**The Gate-B triviality skip needs two independent conditions**, and an eligible profile
never makes a behaviour-changing diff skippable: the change itself is **behaviourally
trivial** (the pre-existing judgement, unchanged by profiles), **and** for a profiled story
`max(risk, security)` is 0 — risk `trivial` *and* security `none`, never risk alone. The
**skip reason is recorded in the commit body** — not in the profile log, which records
profile *changes*, and a skip changes no profile value. **A skip removes the review, never
the evidence**, and what is owed follows the profile: a skipped **profiled** story runs the
battery and lands its evidence entry beside the reason; a skipped **unprofiled** story
records the reason and the battery result and nothing more, because it owes no mode-derived
entry and keeps exactly today's judgement-based skip.

**A cycle citing several stories** aggregates along separate dimensions, never through one
winning mode: the **battery runs once** for the cycle; **each cited _profiled_ story
satisfies its own mode and suffix**, with its own named evidence entry, while a cited
**unprofiled** story has no mode and owes no entry; the **lens sets are unioned** across
all cited stories; and the cycle is skip-eligible only if **every** cited story is. A
single "max" would either under-serve the strictest story or impose its obligations on
unrelated ones.

**What the author owes before Gate B**, by mode: `battery` = the quality battery green ·
`battery+check` = battery + **a check that fails without the change** ·
`battery+check+verification` = battery + that check + a **named** verification of the risk
path · `+abuse-path` = one **named** abuse scenario plus evidence that the expected control
rejects or contains it. Level 2's two obligations are distinct; one artifact serves both
only if it demonstrates both.

A check need not be an automated test — where none is possible, a **named verification**
satisfies it and the entry says which route was taken and why. Either route owes the
**counterfactual**: the observation against the prior state. An **unobservable
counterfactual is a blocking evidence gap**, not a free pass — stop and surface; the human
may then lower the mode as a logged override. A fabricated test satisfies nothing. **Name
the observation that would exist if the claim were false, and confirm the wiring could have
produced it** — a check that supplies its own input, runs where the defect cannot appear, or
uses a fixture that never reaches the branch it covers reports success because of how it was
wired, not because the thing it checks succeeded.

**The evidence entry lives in the commit body** (see Mechanics), carries the **story path
and the named evidence but not the mode value**, and is **revalidated before every Gate-B
re-review and before the cycle-closing amend** — a fix changes the diff even when the
profile sits still. If revalidation changes the entry, the clean pass no longer covers what
is being committed: fix, re-review, close on the entry that pass validated.

**Every Gate-B call and re-review carries the path of every cited story**, so the reviewer
reads each profile itself, **plus the current evidence entry, quoted verbatim, for each
cited *profiled* story** — an unprofiled one owes no mode-derived evidence, so it
contributes a path and nothing else. One profiled story means one pair; a cycle citing
several carries all of them, because the reviewer cannot union lenses it cannot see or
judge evidence it was never given. A reviewer handed neither can only review the diff —
the lenses and the evidence obligations would exist and never be consumed.

**Two evidence gaps, two different answers.** Evidence that is *absent or inadequate* for
the mode is a **work gap**: produce it, then call. A project whose `AGENTS.md` names **no
verified quality command** cannot satisfy even `battery` — a **setup gap**: say what is
missing (`/workflow-init`'s battery step) rather than reviewing around it. Neither is a
reason to call Gate B against a weaker claim.

**Changing a profile:** the pass **proposes the complete resulting header** — both axes,
the recomputed mode, any renewed override — and the **human confirms it**, in both
directions; an agent never moves it alone. On confirmation, correct the header and append
one profile-log line. Any axis change **voids every prior override**, raised or lowered,
and `+abuse-path` follows the current security value. Passes already run under the lower
profile **keep counting** toward the floor; only the **final clean pass** must run under
the current profile. Inside an active Gate-B cycle, fold the edit into the active `WIP:`
snapshot by amend — a non-`WIP` commit reads to the hook as the cycle closing and would
discard the accumulated passes.

**What this does not do:** nothing checks which file a model actually read, whether the
header changed mid-call, or whether the lens sets were appended. This is instruction-backed
like the rest of §5; the detection is a reader comparing the pass against the story.

### Mechanics (reference)
- **Severity:** Blocker (wrong/unsafe/breaks invariant) · Major (design flaw →
  rework) → both must resolve. Minor · Nit → collect, never iterate.
- **Tool routing:** docs (spec/plan, incl. code snippets) → `mcp__codex__exec`;
  implemented diff → `mcp__codex__review`. Never `review` a doc — it reads the
  git range, not the text.
- **`baseSha`:** against main = merge-base with main (`headSha` = HEAD);
  pre-commit, `baseSha` = HEAD is an empty range (HEAD..HEAD) — make a WIP commit
  and set `baseSha` to its parent. **Name that commit `WIP: …`** — the hook treats a
  `wip`-prefixed commit message as cycle-internal, so it neither fires a Gate-B STOP
  nor resets your pass counters. A pre-review snapshot named anything else reads as a
  real commit and closes the cycle, discarding the passes you just accumulated.
  **Finishing the cycle:** after the final clean pass, close it with
  `git commit --amend -m "<real message>"` — that replaces the WIP commit, and the hook
  reads the amend as the real cycle-closing commit. If several WIP snapshots piled up,
  `git reset --soft <parent-of-first-WIP>` first, then commit once. Amend rather than a
  follow-up commit for two reasons: a `WIP: …` commit left in history defeats the naming
  convention it exists for, and a follow-up commit has nothing to commit when the review
  produced no fixes.
  **The closing message carries the validated evidence entry for every cited profiled
  story** — one each, and none for a cited unprofiled story, which owes no entry. The
  amend replaces the WIP message wholesale, so an entry written only into the WIP body is
  destroyed exactly when the cycle closes. The final commit body is the durable record;
  a PR shows commit messages, so there is no second home to keep in sync.

  **On squash-merge, copy every evidence entry and every human-exception record in the squash range into the squash body — the squash commit is the only body the merge carries into `main`'s history, so anything left behind is unreachable from it.**

  **Recording a human exception.** Where a human decides that something **no applicable rule
  required** was nonetheless worth skipping — an optional check this environment cannot run, a
  review someone asked for and then stood down, a courtesy step — that decision goes in the
  closing commit body:

  ```
  Human exception: <handle> · <date>
  Not done: <what was skipped, specifically>
  Accepted because: <one line>
  ```

  **Which commit:** an ungated change records it in that commit; a Gate-A cycle in the spec or
  plan commit; a Gate-B cycle in the WIP commit, restated by the closing amend. Several records
  accumulate; order means nothing.

  **A decision made after its commit closed** — during PR review, say — goes in whichever of
  these exists: the next commit on the branch, the squash body, or a follow-up commit after the
  merge. If none does — the branch is closed, unmerged, and heading for an ordinary or rebase
  merge — **add a commit for it.** An empty commit carrying only the record is a legitimate
  destination: it changes no content, so it raises no review obligation. A record with nowhere
  to go would otherwise be a record that does not exist.

  **Do not expect silence from the gate hook, and do not read a reminder as a gate
  reopening.** It is advisory, so it never blocks the commit attempt. What is exempt is the
  **empty diff**, which `git show --stat` confirms — never a reminder that merely looks the
  same on a commit carrying content.

  Copy every record into the squash body alongside the evidence entry (Mechanics,
  squash-merge carry). **Nothing performs that carry and nothing checks afterwards that it
  happened** — it is on whoever prepares the merge. If two copies of one record disagree, that
  is a copying error: stop and fix it rather than picking one.

  **Scope, and it is narrow. This form supplies no permission.** It records a decision that
  was already the human's to make about something genuinely optional. It is **never** the answer to a
  below-floor pass, an unclean final pass, a `STOP and surface`, a Gate-A or Gate-B
  obligation, or a profile-derived evidence requirement — and more generally **it authorizes
  nothing that any mandatory rule in this file or in `AGENTS.md` requires.** Those have their
  own terminal actions and this paragraph changes none of them: on a STOP you still stop, and
  neither a human's assent nor this record lets an agent close or continue a cycle.

  **"Mandatory" is not limited to this file.** A rule in `AGENTS.md`, a project doc, CI, a
  branch policy or the platform is equally out of reach — under **Wait for**,
  `docs/pr-review-bots.md` requires a bot review unless an explicit recorded human decision
  permits proceeding without it, and this form is not that decision. If you are reaching for it to get past something mandatory, the answer
  is no — take the operational route or stop.

  **Nor is it for things that were simply never owed.** An absent review from a bot routed
  **opportunistically** blocks nothing and needs no exception and no record;
  `docs/pr-review-bots.md` says so deliberately, and writing one anyway would rebuild the
  per-quiet-bot ceremony that routing removed. Record a decision, not a non-event.

  **What the record is worth.** It is an **unverified assertion**, and reads as one: nothing
  checks that the handle belongs to whoever decided, that a human was asked, or that the
  reason is honest. A reader of history learns that *the commit claims* a human chose, what
  it says was skipped, and why — no more. It supports no claim of authorization or review,
  and satisfies no evidence obligation. It exists because an exception nobody wrote down is
  invisible, not because writing it down makes it sound.
- **Timeout / abort:** a codex call that dies at the MCP tool-call timeout is retried
  once before surfacing to the user, and that retry *is* the single shared recovery
  attempt above — not a second one. An abort is an incomplete pass, so treat it as one:
  it may have left a partial or stale target file, so delete the targets and confirm them
  gone before retrying, then validate the result like any other pass. Whether it moved the
  hook's counter depends on the shape it returned and on which hook version is installed:
  as of 0.8.0 a recognized failure envelope, the recognized backgrounding notice and a
  result yielding no usable text are all withheld from the count, while a reordered,
  reworded or unrecognized shape still counts fail-open. Do not reason from the counter
  either way — an incomplete pass is discounted whatever it says. Counter and workspace
  state persist in `.context/`; the *pass* does not.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

Project architecture, stack-specific patterns, and invariants live in @AGENTS.md
(single source of truth — also read directly by Codex and the PR review bots). The
Cross-Model Review gates (§5) check against the invariants there.
