# Hardening taxonomy — sfx-bricks-child

Project-specific fingerprint classes, extending the stack-neutral **base taxonomy**
in the `dev-workflow:harden-finding` skill. The skill reads both on every fingerprint
step; the base classes are not repeated here.

A class belongs here (not in the base list) when it names *this* project's entities,
frameworks, or invariants — e.g. a class about a specific table, a specific auth
helper, or a specific framework's API.

**Before minting:** grep the base list and this one for a near match. A slightly
imprecise class you reuse beats a precise class nobody greps for — recurrence
detection is the entire value, and it only works when the same defect maps to the
same string twice.

**Format:** kebab-case `domain-problem-class`, one line, with an alias hint naming
the synonyms a future reader might search for instead.

## Classes

<!-- Add classes as harden-finding mints them, e.g.:
- `orders-missing-idempotency-key` — a retryable order write accepted without an idempotency key
-->

_None yet — `dev-workflow:harden-finding` adds them as findings arrive._
