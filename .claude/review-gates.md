# Cross-Model Review (Codex) — TWO MANDATORY GATES

This is `CLAUDE.md` §5 in full, moved here unchanged except where the text named its own
location. Everything below that says "this section" or "§5" means this file.

Independent second opinion at two gates. Easiest steps to skip, so the discipline is
yours — a non-blocking hook (shipped by the `dev-workflow` plugin) reminds you at
each. Opt out per-workspace with `.context/codex-gate.off` (delete to re-enable); the
gates still apply. The hook counts passes by TOOL NAME (`mcp__codex__exec` /
`mcp__codex__review`) and by RESULT ENVELOPE — it withholds the count for a routed gate
call whose result it reads as failed, backgrounded, or yielding no usable text; for Gate B it also reads the REQUEST, counting a `spec` and a `quality` call on identical 40-character lowercase `baseSha`/`headSha` as one pass and a lone branch as none. If your
Codex MCP server names its tools differently, map it in `.context/codex-gate.tools`
(`execTool=<name>` / `reviewTool=<name>`) — otherwise your reviews are invisible to the
counters and Gate B reports "not run" forever. A mapped name must itself start with
`mcp__codex__`, or it is refused — outside that namespace it is either never delivered
to the hook or, for `Bash`/`Skill`, hijacks a lifecycle event. Register the server as
`codex` to place its tools there.

**Both gates are a LOOP with a HARD FLOOR: a minimum number of passes per run (a clean final pass
being what the floor is spent on, and cleanliness taking more than Blocker/Major), derived from the
cited story's profile.**
The derivation is max(risk, security): a value of 0 gives a floor of 1; every
resolvable profile above that, and an artifact citing no story, gives 3. Two levels,
not three — `high` takes its rigor from lens sets and evidence mode, not from extra
passes. A cited story whose profile is present but unresolvable stops and surfaces
under the existing rule; it does not fall through to 3, because reading it as 3 would
turn a stop condition into a silent default. Across a cited set the floor is 1 if and
only if the set is non-empty and every member is profiled, resolvable and at level 0
— all four conditions, since "every cited story" is vacuously true of an empty set;
no story cited, or any cited story unprofiled, gives 3. One derived value governs all
three cycle *kinds*: the Gate-A spec loop, the Gate-A plan loop and the Gate-B cycle. Not
because they are one cycle — they are separate cycles, and a change carrying several plans runs
a Gate-A plan cycle per plan — but because they derive from the same
cited-story set. That value is a function of the current confirmed profiles of that set,
read fresh wherever this section already requires them to be read, so wherever a value can be
derived at all there is exactly one, because there is one source. Some states derive **no** value
rather than a second one, and each stops rather than defaulting: governing headers that
disagree; a cited profile that is present but unresolvable; and a `Story:` header that cannot
be read. A change to a profile or to the set
therefore binds every open and future cycle — a raise costs an affected open cycle a
further pass under the current profile, as the profile-change rule below requires — while a
cycle that has already closed
stands, its close having been valid under the profile current when it closed, which is the
cycle-level form of passes already run keeping their count. **The set has one authority:
the artifact's `Story:` header, which carries the path of every cited story.** Nothing else
is a citation. A story path appearing anywhere else in an artifact's body — including a
sentence placing a story *outside* this change's scope — **contributes nothing to the cited
set and nothing to the floor derivation**, which is the only claim made about it; it may still
be a perfectly good cross-reference for any other purpose. And **an agent
deriving the set reads that header and does not grep the body for story paths**, because a
grep finds mentions and cannot tell a citation from a disclaimer. **Each cycle's governing header is the
header of the artifact it reviews**: the spec's for the Gate-A spec loop, the plan's for the
Gate-A plan loop, and — since a Gate-B cycle reviews a diff and has no header of its own —
**the union of the `Story:` headers of every plan contributing to that diff, which the Gate-B
call must carry in full**, as this section already requires of every cited path. **Every expected artifact contributes a set — a spec, and every plan contributing to the
reviewed diff — and an expected artifact whose `Story:` header is absent contributes the empty
set rather than dropping out of the comparison.** **One path per entry**, and "entry" is
decidable against the form these artifacts actually carry: a single line beginning `**Story:**`,
then one or more paths, **each wrapped in backticks**, separated by `, `. Trailing prose after
the last path is allowed and contributes nothing — several headers carry a reminder to read the
profile fresh, and a reminder is not a citation. So a header citing several stories carries several entries,
one path each. Exact duplicate paths are one member; entries naming different stories are
different members; and a header that does not parse as that line is malformed and stops,
reporting that as the cause rather than as a disagreement. **Before each pass the deriving agent
compares every such set, and again before a clean pass is accepted as the cycle's final pass.**
A header or profile that changed during that pass means the pass is not final — the same
answer a change gets at every other read point. Where they name different sets the premise of a single value has
failed: **stop and surface the disagreement** rather than deriving from either, exactly as an
unresolvable profile stops rather than defaulting.

**The derived floor is the pass count a cycle owes, and the hook's ratio is a reminder
threshold that controls nothing.** The hook still counts passes, and it still can't read
findings or tell the spec run from the plan run (it resets at `writing-plans`), so
Gate A — the spec run especially — is instruction-backed: a satisfied count is not a
clean review, and a below-threshold reminder is noted in the pass report and disregarded
where the cycle's own closure rules are satisfied. Every other rule stated **in this paragraph** about how a cycle closes stands as written, and
none of them is restated — a summary is where their conditions would get dropped. Nothing here writes the floor knob: it stays the user's, never written, never
removed, never read for this derivation. Open a TodoWrite "Codex pass N" per pass; resolve Blocker/Major after each as
Mechanics · Severity requires. What a clean final pass and the zero-finding early exit mean for closing is stated once in the
closure ordering. Codex is advisory — validate before applying; dismissed finding → one-line why.

**Named residual:** the hook's messages state its own threshold as an obligation, so at a
floor of 1 they report a shortfall the cycle does not owe. **That particular overstatement is out of scope here by decision, and it is not a blanket exemption for hook text** — a reminder this change's own rules falsify is corrected in the same change.
What makes that tolerable is the precedence rule above plus the hook exiting
0 on every branch, not the reminder being harmless.

**The gate-off surface — routes known today, not a complete list**, since an enumeration
read as complete guarantees the routes it omits. One route is created here: a stated floor
the cited set does not license, which could not exist before there was a derived floor to
state. Pre-existing and unchanged: omitting a higher-risk cited story; minting or editing a
profile to level 0; presenting an incomplete cited set; falsifying evidence entries;
silencing reminders; or not running a pass and reporting that it ran. A user-set floor is
not the lever — it moves what the hook says, not what the cycle owes.
None of this is a guard: the floor is produced by the agent and nothing checks it against
the cited profiles.

**When these rules bind.** From the commit that ships them, and a cycle already running
finishes under the rules it started with. Where a cycle's starting rules cannot be
established it takes the stricter reading of every part this change touches — at minimum floor 3, severity classified without the demotion, the provenance-line duty owed, the curve duty owed,
the nonce duties at their strictest, **every suspension binding, since
starting rules that cannot be established cannot be read as having waived an open hold**, **the
repeated-dismissal cleanliness exclusion unavailable, a cycle that cannot establish its starting
rules being unable to establish that they contained it**, **the parked state binding after a closing act that cannot
be repaired, a cycle whose starting rules cannot be established being the last one that should be
left with no terminal transition**, and **every closure condition and
pass-cost rule this change ships owed rather than waived — Gate A's content condition and its
commit-carry duty, and the further pass an assigned-fix-set change costs — since a rule that cannot
be established as absent is cheaper to owe than to skip** — the cycle is treated as post-rule, so it
owes a nonce, owes its provenance line and its curve or skip record, and uses that nonce in every
cycle record it does write — which changes what a record is named, never whether one is owed, so
the working record stays optional and a skipped cycle still writes no findings slots. Where it
cannot recover a nonce it starts a new cycle rather than claiming `none (pre-rule)`, that reserved
field being unavailable to a cycle whose start cannot be established. Each further rule this change ships adds its own strict
reading to this list. Not a re-derivation, which could hand a level-0
cycle a floor of 1 and skip passes on the strength of not knowing when it started. A user
knob set above 3 is not lowered by this fallback. A revert is itself a shipping commit for
the old rules, and the activation rule wins wherever the start is determinable; the
fallback covers only where it is not.

**Downstream has no shipping commit.** Adoption binds from the `/workflow-init` run that
actually writes the text — which may write nothing, be declined, or be merged in part —
so these rules bind only over the text a project's `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/review-gates.md` actually contain, and a
partial adoption can persist undetected. A project taking the floor rule without the
severity test gets a floor whose docs-only question the severity test is what settles.
**A partial adoption can leave a project's floor undefined or self-contradictory.** The rule
is a coherence requirement, stated semantically rather than as a list of spellings, and it
runs in **both** directions: **exactly one definition of the floor must be present, and every
statement that defines or constrains the floor, or makes closing depend on it, must resolve to
that one definition.** **The unknown-start fallback is not a second definition**: it is
explicitly conditional on a cycle's starting rules being undeterminable and governs only that
state, so it coexists with the predicate rather than competing with it. Everything else
likewise keeps its own footing and is **not** required to derive from the floor: **the other closure and stop predicates** — assigned-fix-set membership, a new
structural question, an accepted Blocker or Major, the tell thresholds; **independent reporting
and diagnostic ordinals**, such as a duty owed from a given pass onward; and **the hook's
reminder threshold together with any descriptive or historical pass number**, which say what a
tool reports or what once happened rather than what a cycle owes. Four states break it, and the list is **not exhaustive**: a fixed-number or
specific-pass obligation surviving beside the derived predicate; a claim or dependency on a
derived floor with no predicate to define it; **no definition at all**; and **two definitions
at once**. A
merge can produce any of them: the Gate-A loop description, the pass-1 closure rule and the
re-review rationale each carry a fixed-three claim and can be taken or left independently of
the predicate itself. In any such state nothing here resolves which rule governs: **stop, and
have a human complete or revert the adoption, before running a gate under it.** What prompt text can do about downstream
adoption is limited, and that limit is what this paragraph states.

**How a cycle ends — one ordering, stated here and referenced everywhere else.** A pass is read in
a fixed order, because every rule bearing on one decision — may this cycle close — otherwise
qualifies the others and the ranking survives only in a reader's head.

**What this paragraph owns.** It owns **how a pass is evaluated and what follows from that**: the
evaluation order, what each predicate is read from, the eligibility test, the hold a surfaced
finding places and what discharges it, the composition of several suspensions, the pairs that
cannot co-occur, and — as a stated exception, because precedence is evaluation order — the
clearly-stuck precedence clause quoted into it below. **No number is put on that list.** Whether
the read model counts as part of the evaluation order or as a thing beside it is a question of
wording, not of authority. It also owns the **classification** of the standing duties below, and
**those duties bind both gates alike**: the derived floor and the Blocker/Major-resolve duty keep
their definitions at their own sources and are read here for every cycle whatever its gate, while
the hold and no-clean-credit are defined here, being properties of the evaluation itself.

**What belongs to a gate is what the two gates do differently: the content condition its closure
requires, where it has one, and the closing act.** **Gate A has such a condition and Gate B has
none**; each paragraph below states its own and is read from there, and **neither gate's paragraph restates the conditions this one gives every cycle**, so
neither is a complete inventory on its own. **Everything else this paragraph names it cites**: the
scope triggers, the assigned fix set, every severity rule and every closure precondition with a
source of its own keep their one definition in the paragraph that owns them, and a reader who finds
one of *those* defined here has found a defect.

**The conditions every cycle has, whatever its gate.** The duties classified below; and the
**profile**, the **cited set** and the **assigned fix set**, each gating as its own source says and
cited here without restatement. **The profile and the assigned fix set answer a change and not a
differing value**, which is why one of them changed and then undone still costs a pass. **The cited
set answers as its own source says**, and that source says two things: a governing header changed
**during** a pass makes that pass not final, and the final clean pass runs against the **current**
set. The contrast that matters is against a gate's own content condition, which may be a comparison
of current values and says so where it is stated.

**What a pass is read from.** Every finding-derived predicate reads the validated findings file
**or files** of the logical pass as **the concatenation of their finding lines after each file has
been validated separately** — a Gate-B pass has two — one per branch, whether one `full` call or two single-branch calls produced them — one branch alone is already an
incomplete pass, each file's terminator is not a finding line, and a branch whose body is
`NO FINDINGS` contributes an empty sequence rather than a line. **Which severity field each
predicate reads is settled in Mechanics · Severity**, which is where that split lives and is not
repeated here. Beyond the findings, closure reads the **derived floor**, the **resolve duty's
standing over this cycle**, any **hold still standing**, and **every closure condition this cycle
has** — those above and this cycle's gate's. The scope triggers read the **current assigned fix
set** as the absorb paragraph defines it, and the answers already given; the clearly-stuck reading
adds its own coverage judgement. **A line in one branch file and a line in the other are distinct
findings for holds and answers**, so a Gate-B pass asks twice rather than risk resuming over one it
never asked about. **Within one running cycle an answer binds to the finding or question as the
pass that raised it recorded them** — which is what an agent running the cycle can do with nothing
written down. Recognising the same finding or question **across a lost session** has no mandatory
identity, sameness or recovery rule in these rules; the optional `<slot>-dispositions.md` note is
advisory and authoritative for nothing.

**The four branches are named, and a cross-reference anywhere in this section names the branch
rather than its position**, so reordering them breaks no reference. **They are read once, on the
pass, before any closing act is attempted** — so a pass that reached the act has already been
classified and is not classified again by what the act does.

**The source-block branch, read first.** **Where any unmet closure condition's own source
prescribes stop-and-surface** — a profile present but unresolvable, governing headers that
disagree, a `Story:` header that cannot be read, an unobservable counterfactual, and **any other
source rule that prescribes it; the list is examples and not the set** — **the cycle stays open, that source decides what
must be repaired or answered, and no further pass runs while its block stands.** It is neither a
suspension nor a continue and needs no name and no procedure of its own: the source rule carries
both, and this ordering's part is to send the reader there rather than to run a pass over a cycle
another rule has stopped. **Once its source condition is repaired**, a block that stood **before any pass of this cycle was
read** — the ones its floor derivation and its cited set raise among them — leaves the cycle to run
its next pass, there being no pass to read again; a block that stood **on a pass already read** has
**that pass read again through the ordering**, no closing act
having been attempted on it — **and where that pass also carried a suspension, this branch
releases only its own block**: the composition rule still holds the cycle on every answer that
suspension asked for, a continue still leads to a pass run after the answer, and a stop still parks
the cycle until an explicit later continue — so the reread happens where no suspension of that
pass is outstanding, and otherwise the suspension's own route runs first — the read-once rule below is about a pass that reached the act, not
about one a block held before it, and without this a repair that moves no pass-cost value would
leave a clean eligible pass with no route to the act and none to a suspension.
**It is read first and it silences nothing.** Where the same pass also
carries a suspension, that suspension is surfaced with its reasons and its questions exactly as the
suspension branch requires and its answers are collected; what the block adds is that **no next
pass runs until its own source condition is repaired**, whatever those answers were.

**Then the clean-completion branch, and eligibility is its own test.** §5 uses *clean* in two
senses and now says which is which: a **clean findings file** is the `NO FINDINGS` signal the
protocol defines, and a **clean pass** is the predicate here, read on the logical pass with every
required branch file combined, so one branch's clean file never establishes a clean pass. **A pass
is clean** when its findings carry no in-set Blocker or Major at effective severity and **no
scope-stop trigger** — the two the absorb paragraph defines, read there and not redefined here,
each already carrying the qualification **an answer given before that pass ran** puts on it. **A
pass's cleanliness is settled on what it found and on the answers standing when it ran**, and a
later answer never rewrites it: an answer discharges the holds it was asked for and leaves the pass
that raised them exactly as clean or unclean as it was, which is the same fact the duties paragraph
states of no-clean-credit. Reading a later answer back onto an earlier pass would let a cycle close
on a pass that was surfaced, answered and never re-run. A pass with **zero** findings is clean
whatever the floor, because a floor buys further looks at an artifact that keeps yielding findings,
and one yielding none has already given what those looks were for; don't manufacture findings to
pad.

**A repetition of a finding this cycle has validly dismissed does not, on its own, make a pass
unclean.** Every part of this is required and the exclusion is narrow: the **dismissal was made in
an earlier pass of this cycle**, its stated reason is **still true of the artifact as it now
stands**, and the later finding **makes the same complaint and brings no new evidence** — no
observation the dismissal did not answer, and no change to the text the reason turned on. Where any
part fails — new evidence, relevant content changed, or genuine doubt that this finding is that
one — the finding is read afresh like any other, and **doubt never resolves in the exclusion's
favour**. Without it the standing duty *dismiss validly, then run another pass* cannot finish,
because a reviewer repeating its own refuted claim would decide whether that claim had been dealt
with. **It reaches only a dismissal this cycle made**, which is what an agent running the cycle
knows; nothing here ships a record, and recognising a dismissal across a lost session has no more
support than the paragraph above gives it.

**It changes cleanliness and nothing else, which is what keeps it from being a waiver.** The
repetition is **still a finding**: it stands in its pass's findings file, and every loop-health
reading counts it exactly as it counts any other, so a loop spending passes on a point it keeps
refuting still shows up as one. It remains the clearly-stuck reading's re-raise condition. **No
earlier pass becomes clean in retrospect** — a pass's cleanliness is settled on what it found and
is never rewritten, which this exclusion leaves untouched: it decides the pass being read and no
other. And it is **not** a second dismissal; the resolve duty was discharged when the finding was
dismissed and there is nothing here to discharge again.

**Eligibility is exactly this and nothing more: a clean pass at or above the derived floor, or a
zero-finding pass.** It is a property of the pass. **Closure is eligibility plus every closure
condition of this cycle holding plus this cycle's gate's closing act**, and those conditions are
properties of the *cycle*, not of the pass — so an eligible pass whose conditions are unmet closes
nothing, and is not thereby made unclean. Keeping the two apart is what lets the order decide the
case where they disagree, which the branches do. **The order inside closure is fixed: every
condition is established first, and only then is the closing act performed.**

**An act that does not complete has not closed the cycle**, and it is not a branch: the branches
below decide what a *pass* is, and this cycle's pass already took the clean-completion branch and
reached closure. **A failed act returns to the closure step it failed in, not to the branches.**
**Nothing is assumed about what the attempt left behind** — a hook can modify and stage content
before failing, so the attempt itself can move what a condition is read from — so surface the
concrete command failure and **re-establish every closure condition against the repository as it
now stands.** Where they all still hold, perform the act again. Where the attempt or its repair
moved anything a condition is read from, **that condition has changed and its own rule decides what
it costs**, a further pass included, and the cycle is back in the ordering with that pass owed.
**Where the failure cannot be repaired at all** — a signing key nobody has, a permission nobody can
grant — **surface it and leave the cycle parked**: open, not running, spending no passes, restarted
by an explicit later continue, which is the state a stop answer already produces and is named here
rather than invented. A cycle that can neither close nor be parked is the outcome this sentence
exists to prevent.

**Closure introduces no new kind of record, and it excuses none**: every other record this cycle
owes, a human-exception record among them, is owed and written exactly as before, and **a
human-exception record this cycle owes goes in the commit its closing act uses**, so the two never
land in different places. **No closure condition is read on the branch tip**, the conditions being
read where their sources say and not off the tip. **That is not a claim that the act publishes what
the pass read.** A commit is written from the effective index, so a staged edit the working tree
does not show lands in the closing commit; where the edit changes something a **source rule**
governs — a profile value, cited-set membership, the assigned fix set — **the change has happened
and that source's own rule applies**, so a further pass is owed and no condition is added here for
it. **Where it changes a review input no source rule governs** — a cited story's acceptance
criteria or settled decisions, say — **nothing here reaches it, and nothing in this section does**:
the artifact's own equality condition covers the artifact, and the inputs beside it have only the
rules their sources give them.

A plateau or tells on **the pass that closes** go into **that pass's status report to the user** —
the carrier the three-line duty already names, and no second report form is introduced — and never
block it, because reporting "will not converge" on a converged loop is a false report; on an
eligible pass that does **not** close they go into the same place, a pass reporting what it read of
the loop whether or not it closes. **No other pass outcome makes a cycle eligible to close**,
because every other pass either leaves a required repair, a hold or a question outstanding, **or
has not reached the floor, or is itself unclean on its own findings** — and closing over any of
those is the failure this ordering exists to prevent. The floor is named separately because a
below-floor pass whose only findings are Minors leaves nothing outstanding and is still not
eligible; **pass-level uncleanliness is named separately** because an in-set Blocker or Major
repaired after the pass that raised it discharges the resolve duty without making that pass clean,
so a cycle can owe nothing and still hold no pass it may close on. The one termination that is not a pass outcome is the Gate-B triviality skip, which runs
no passes and is outside this ordering.

**Then the suspension branch, which a pass reaches where the clean-completion branch did not take
it and a suspension applies to it.** **Clean completion outranks a suspension by taking the pass to
the closing act, not by eligibility alone**: a pass that took the branch above, met
every closure condition and had the closing act performed has ended the cycle, and a suspension has
nothing left to suspend. **A pass the clean-completion branch did not take reaches this branch
whatever its cleanliness, where a suspension applies to it** — a clean pass below the floor, and
equally an eligible pass whose unmet closure conditions kept that branch from taking it. Cleanliness is what this branch stops
asking about; whether a suspension applies is still what puts a pass here, and where none does the
continue branch has it. That is what makes "clean completion outranks the two-tell stop"
executable rather than asserted, and cleanliness alone never decides it. **What D2 and D3 forbid is
reporting "will not converge" on a loop that converged, and a loop still owing a repair, an answer
or a closure condition has not converged** — so a mandatory two-tell stop and the clearly-stuck
reading stay reachable exactly where the loop is still running, which is the only place their
question means anything. Three suspensions, by the names their
paragraphs use and read by those paragraphs: the **scope stop**, raised by either trigger above — a
**membership stop** by the first, a **question stop** by the second; the **clearly-stuck exit**;
and the **two-tell stop**. A suspension waives nothing. Any non-empty set of them can apply to one
pass: **one surface, every reason reported, every question asked**, because a reason left out is a
decision made by omission. A finding the clearly-stuck reading surfaces that also carries either
trigger takes the scope stop's answers at that same surface, so it is not asked twice; the two-tell
stop surfaces tells and not a finding.

**Otherwise the continue branch, which no source block reaches: where none stands and neither of
the two branches above took the pass, it continues** — the loop
runs another pass on the **current** artifact, revised where the severity and scope rules require a
repair and unrevised where they do not. **An eligible pass with an unmet closure condition lands
here**, and like every other non-closing pass **only where no suspension applies to it**: clean
completion did not take it, so the loop continues on whatever the unmet condition requires — most
often a repair still owed from an earlier pass. A below-floor clean pass lands here on the same
terms; where a suspension does apply, the suspension branch has already taken it, because only
the clean-completion branch outranks a suspension. So does a pass whose only findings are Minors and
Nits **and which carries no scope-stop trigger** — those are collected and never iterated and may
leave nothing to revise, while a Minor or Nit **carrying a scope-stop trigger as the absorb
passage defines one** carries it like any other finding, is not clean, and has already been taken
by the suspension branch — **severity does not raise a trigger and does not suppress one**, and
which findings raise one is that passage's entire, an already-declined finding raising no
membership trigger and an already-answered question no question trigger. It is a branch and
not an inference, because "does not close" read alone says nothing about whether to run again.

**The four standing duties, classified.** The **derived floor** is a **precondition on closure**:
it gates closing, discharged by the count of valid logical passes reaching it with the last of them
clean, or by the zero-finding exit. The **Blocker/Major-resolve duty** is a **precondition on
closure**: Mechanics · Severity, scoped to the assigned fix set, states what it demands and what
discharges it, at that source and not here. **It is discharged per finding and tracked across the
cycle, never inferred from a later pass.** A findings file establishes the **inventory** of what
that pass found and not the resolution of anything, so a later pass that does not mention an
earlier in-set Blocker or Major says nothing about whether it was resolved; reading its absence as
discharge would let an omission close a cycle. **The duty is not a second test on whether a pass is
clean, and the two are not run together.** A pass is clean on its own findings. Stated as the case
that separates them, because a reader who conflates them decides it wrongly: **pass 1 raises an
in-set Major; it is not resolved; pass 2 finds nothing.** Pass 2 **is** clean, and at or above the
floor it is **eligible** — and the cycle **still cannot close**, the duty being unmet; it takes the
continue branch until that Major is discharged. What the open Major does *not* do is make pass 2
unclean. The **hold** a surfaced finding places on closure **participates in the ordering**: it
gates closing while it stands, and is discharged by the answers that surface requires. **It
attaches to every surfaced finding, whichever suspension surfaced it** — clean completion creates
none, because it wins before anything is surfaced. **No-clean-credit** — no pass carrying a
scope-stop trigger is credited as clean — also participates, and is a fact about that pass that
nothing discharges, a later pass being judged on its own findings. It is not a second test beside
the clean predicate but that predicate's second half, which is why it is stated in its words.

**What a suspension asks, and what ends it.** **A hold ends when every answer its finding requires
has been given, in whichever direction each is given** — one **scope-stop** answer for a
single-trigger finding, both for one carrying both. That is **one rule with two parts**, how many
answers and which way each may go, and neither is a test the other has to pass. Where a health
suspension applies to the same pass, its shared continue-or-stop answer is **additional** to those
and not counted among them, the health readings asking about the loop rather than about this
finding. **The two health readings differ in what they surface, and therefore in what they hold.**
The **two-tell stop surfaces tells and no finding**, so it creates no hold; what it leaves
outstanding is its own continue-or-stop question, which the composition rule below holds the cycle
on until it is answered. The **clearly-stuck reading surfaces findings** — **the findings of the
pass being read that satisfy its regeneration condition, and only those**; earlier members of a
regeneration chain that were repaired or dismissed are history the reading consults and never
findings it re-surfaces, so no discharged finding takes a second hold. Each surfaced finding takes
a hold like any other. **A re-raised valid dismissal stays discharged for the resolve duty on
exactly the terms the clean predicate sets out above** — the same complaint, no new evidence, no
change to the text the dismissal turned on, and the dismissal's reason still true of the artifact.
The dismissal was the resolution and a reviewer repeating it does not undo it, so no second
dismissal is owed. **Where any of those fails the recurrence is an ordinary fresh finding** and is
handled as one — by the severity and scope rules at their own sources, which decide whether it is
in set and what it owes; reading the old dismissal as covering it would let a finding that has
since become true close a cycle. What a
qualifying recurrence creates is the **clearly-stuck hold**, ended by that reading's
continue-or-stop answer. Any trigger the recurrence independently carries raises its own
stop as usual. **Where one finding is surfaced by more than one route it carries a hold
component per route, and each is discharged by its own answer**: the **membership** component by
the membership answer **in either direction**, a decline releasing it exactly as an accept does;
the **question** component by the user's decision on that question; the **clearly-stuck** component
by that reading's continue-or-stop answer. **No answer discharges another route's component**, and
a finding surfaced by one route has one component, discharged by the one answer its surface asks
for. **Resumption is still the
composition rule's**, which waits for every outstanding answer. At a **membership stop** the answer is **accept** or **decline**;
**what each does to the assigned fix set is the absorb paragraph's, which defines that set from
these outcomes**, and what an in-set finding then owes is Mechanics · Severity's. A later answer
that contradicts a decline **does not reverse it**: the decline **remains binding** and the
contradiction is **surfaced to the user as information**, changing neither membership, nor the
cycle's state, nor any outstanding question — **whether the loop resumes is decided by the
composition rule below and by nothing here**, so a contradictory answer is never itself a
resumption and cannot step past a hold or a health question still awaiting its own answer. Nothing
here turns one answer into another, since that would let a finding be moved out of the set and back
into it to escape what it owes inside it. **There is no withdrawal inside the cycle that
declined**, a decline binding for the remainder of its cycle and admitting no exception; a
reconsideration is a later cycle's, where that decline has no effect at all and the finding takes
the ordinary route. Either answer is an **explicit, attributable decision on that specific
finding** — never silence, never a general remark about scope, never inferred, because a fix set
changed by inference is a fix set nobody chose. **Membership is answered against the set as the
absorb paragraph fixes it for the pass that raised the question**: a later broadening is a new fact
the **next** pass reads and never discharges a standing hold, a hold discharged by a scope change
being a hold nobody answered. At a **question stop** the answer is the user's decision on the
question and membership does not change; an out-of-set finding that opened one is a membership stop
as well. **Decline is available only at a membership stop**, that being the only stop whose
question is whether a finding belongs to the set. The **clearly-stuck and two-tell readings** ask
**continue or stop**. **Continue consumes the reading that raised the suspension**: a further
health suspension needs that reading recomputed over a pass run after the answer, which is new
data — so continue produces a distinct next state, and the same reading cannot return the same stop
unanswered. It permits an **unrevised** artifact **only where no repair is owed**; where effective
severity or scope requires one, that repair comes before the post-answer pass, since a pass run
over an unrepaired in-set Blocker or Major spends a look on text the rules already say must change.
**Stop parks the cycle**: open, not running, spending no passes, restarted only by an explicit
later continue — a distinct state from the suspended-awaiting-answer one it was in before the
answer. **That continue restarts the cycle and never skips an answer**: where any question the
suspension raised is still outstanding, it returns the cycle to suspended-awaiting-answer, and only
once every answer the composition rule requires has been given does the next pass run. So a cycle
parked with an unanswered membership or question stop cannot be continued into a pass, and cannot
sit parked with no transition either — the continue is always available and always moves it.
Nothing a parked cycle wrote is a closing commit, and a parked cycle nobody restarts is a human's
to resolve, exactly as the nonce rules already say of open cycles.

**Composition, and what cannot happen.** Every **question** is answered on its own and the loop
resumes only when every answer resumes it — accept or decline at a membership stop, a decision at a
question stop, continue at the health readings; one stop answer parks the whole suspension, because
a loop resumed over an unanswered question decides it by running. **The clearly-stuck and two-tell
readings raise one question between them, not two**, both asking continue or stop, so one answer
carrying every reason ends both — an instance of the sentence before it, not an exception. **Two
pairings cannot occur**, and no rule ranks them: clean completion and a **scope stop**, since that
stop's triggers are the clean predicate's own second half, so a pass raising one is not clean; and
a zero-finding pass and any suspension, since it has nothing to surface, nothing regenerating, no
cluster and no require↔withdraw pair. **Clean completion and the clearly-stuck exit can**, and the
overlap is admitted rather than argued away: the two read different severity fields, as
Mechanics · Severity sets out, so an **in-set** Blocker or Major the ceiling demotes below Major
can regenerate across passes on a pass that is clean. **A declined finding is not a route into that
reading**: the third condition admits regeneration across repair attempts and a qualifying
re-raised validated dismissal, and a decline is neither — it is the user's decision that a *true* finding stays outside
the set, and it binds for the cycle. **The order decides it and no new rule is needed.** The
clearly-stuck paragraph's own precedence clause is stated here rather than there, because
precedence is evaluation order and this paragraph is where evaluation order is stated once; the
rationale that clause turns on stays beside the reading in that paragraph, which is where the
reading itself lives. **A clean completion takes precedence over this exit**: a Blocker/Major-free
pass **at or above the floor** has satisfied the clean-final-pass rule — collect the Minors and
Nits and close — and reporting "will not converge" on a converged loop is a false report. Below the
floor the pass **suspends**, the clean pass having failed eligibility. **That sentence ranks two
readings and licenses no closure**, its "close" being the closure this ordering defines and
carrying every condition that closure carries: a Minor or Nit bearing a scope-stop trigger makes
the pass unclean, so the sentence does not reach it, and an undischarged duty, a standing hold or
an unmet gate condition means the pass does not close — leaving it on the suspension branch where
one applies and the continue branch where none does, exactly as those branches say.

**Gate A's content condition, and its closing act.** These are what Gate A adds to the conditions
the ordering states for every cycle; that list is there and is not repeated here.

**Its content condition: the artifact as it now stands is identical to the text that went into the
final pass's review request.** Gate A hands the reviewer text rather than a git range, which is why
this condition is Gate A's and is written nowhere else. It is **current equality and deliberately
nothing more**: it does **not** say the artifact went untouched in between, and text edited and
then restored byte for byte satisfies it — stated here because the ordering's conditions answer a change
instead, and said of this condition rather than as a claim about every other.
That is a decision rather than an oversight: a content comparison cannot tell those two states
apart, and a condition nobody can check is a condition nobody applies. It likewise says nothing
about **what the reviewer consumed**: no part of this act is offered as evidence of the review
payload.

**The act.** A Gate-A cycle has no WIP snapshot to replace, so it closes by **writing the closing
commit — or the closing message of one that already exists — carrying the records this cycle
already owes**: its provenance line and its per-pass curve, in the forms Mechanics fixes, neither
of them altered. **The content must survive into that commit, and carrying it there is part of the
act**: the equality above is read on the artifact, while the commit is written from the effective
index, so an act that does not carry that same content through has checked the condition without
performing it. **The commit that closes the cycle contains, at the artifact path, exactly the text
the condition was read against.** The safe command sequence and whatever demonstrates it belong to
the plan; **the duty belongs here**, and it needs no new fingerprint and no new record.

**Two cases, told apart by the repository's current state rather than by which commit introduced
what; the safe git sequence for each belongs to the plan. That reading decides how a cycle closes,
never whether it may.**
- **`HEAD` already carries that text at the artifact path.** Close by **amending `HEAD`'s message**
  to add the records, leaving that path as it stands.
- **`HEAD` does not, the reviewed text being still uncommitted.** **Commit it unchanged** and close
  in that commit. This case had no answer before: an eligible pass over repairs nobody had
  committed could neither close nor suspend.

**No new revision of the artifact is made to close a Gate-A cycle**, a new revision being one no
pass has run against — and committing already-reviewed text that was never committed is not one.

**Gate B's content condition, and its closing act.** These are what Gate B adds to the conditions
the ordering states for every cycle; that list is there and is not repeated here, so nothing below
is an inventory of what this gate requires. **This gate adds no content condition of its own**,
and the next paragraph says why.

**Its content condition is not an artifact/request equality, and none is written for it.** Gate B
reviews a **diff** identified by `baseSha` and `headSha` rather than a text handed to the reviewer,
so there is no reviewed text to compare an artifact against, and **nothing is put in its place**:
content the final review request did not select can reach the closing commit, and **no rule in this
section reaches it**. **What this gate does have is every Gate-B duty this section already
states, at the paragraphs that state them, and none of them is summarised here** — a compressed
inventory is where a load-bearing part goes missing while the list still looks complete.

**The act** is the one Mechanics · Finishing the cycle describes, in whichever shape that section
gives the repository's current state. **This paragraph says when it is performed and never which
shape it takes**: once the ordering reaches it, on an eligible pass with every closure condition
holding, **never a clean pass on its own**.

**A commit the hook reads as cycle-closing is a Gate-B matter.** A non-`WIP` commit mid-cycle makes
the hook drop its Gate-B review state and that gate's counter — an observation about the counter,
since the cycle itself stays open until the conditions hold, so an accidental commit resets what
the hook reports and closes nothing; **what the reset erases is counter state, and it does not
invalidate a pass that already satisfied the validation rules this section states** — which is
where what makes a pass valid stays. **A stray commit that succeeds and does not amend also leaves the
`WIP:` snapshot as an ancestor**, an amend replacing the tip instead —
so in that one shape **the closing act still owes what Mechanics already requires of it: no `WIP:`
commit left in history.** Which git sequence reaches that from this state
belongs to the plan, as every other closing sequence does. **It does not reach a Gate-A cycle's count**, which the hook
clears at the skill boundaries that start a new Gate-A cycle rather than on any commit.

**What a loop absorbs, and what stops it — a question of scope, not of action.** A finding
that corrects the correction you just made **and stays inside the assigned fix set** is
**inside this loop's scope**: keep it here rather than handing it back, then act on it by its
severity exactly as Mechanics · Severity says. Ancestry decides where a finding belongs; it
never decides what you do with it, and it grants no Minor or Nit a repair round it would not
otherwise get. **The assigned fix set is fixed before the pass you are answering: it is the
union of the scope every approved story or plan governing this change assigns to this cycle,
plus every finding this cycle has accepted at a membership stop together with any repair
obligation accepted with it, minus every finding this cycle has declined.** **A decline excludes
the finding it answers and nothing else**: it does not cancel a repair obligation that the
approved scope, or another accepted finding, has independently put in the set. So where a Gate-B pass's two branch files carry the same complaint, **each line is a finding of its own, owes
its own explicit answer, and each answer binds only its own line** — an acceptance puts its own
finding in, a decline takes only its own finding out, and neither reads the other; the set is
whatever the definition above then computes. **A declined finding stays declined for the cycle**,
and performing a repair to discharge a different finding's obligation neither reverses that
decision nor returns it to the set. **This adds no deduplication, no reconciliation stop and no
rule that an acceptance overrides a decline** — the two answers are about different findings, and
until both are given the unanswered one's membership hold stands. **An accept puts the
finding in the set whatever its severity**: membership and the repair duty are different things,
so a Minor or Nit accepted into the set is in it though Mechanics · Severity asks no repair for
it, and a later pass that recomputed it as outside would raise the membership question a second
time and make the accept decide nothing. A finding is in-set when repairing it stays inside **the assigned fix set as
just defined** — never merely because it arrived in the current pass, which would put every new
finding in the set by definition and leave the boundary deciding nothing. Where membership is
genuinely unclear treat the finding as **outside**, which costs a question and never a silent
expansion. **A correction that leaves that set stops the loop like any other out-of-scope
finding** — except one this cycle has already declined, which is outside the set by that
decision and **raises no membership trigger on that account**, its membership being the one
question already answered — even when it opens no new question at all, and the membership
answer ends that finding's membership hold; **what the pass does next is the closure
ordering's**, which resumes only when every answer outstanding on that surface has been given.
A finding that opens a **new structural or contract question** — new meaning not already
answered in this cycle, so an answered question raised again stops nothing — stops the loop and
goes to the user — **size is not the test, novelty of the question is**, so a structural finding
that is genuinely small still stops it, while a long correction still aimed at the last
correction does not — provided that correction, too, stays inside the set, which its ancestry
never supplies on its own. **When a finding is both** — it corrects the last correction *and*
opens a new structural or contract question — **the new question wins and the loop stops**:
novelty overrides correction ancestry, because absorbing on ancestry is exactly how a contract
decision gets made without anyone choosing it. **Novelty overrides ancestry and nothing else:
where the finding is also out of set, both triggers hold and both answers are owed**, since a
question answered about a finding nobody placed in or out of the set leaves its membership
decided by default. Stopping this way is **not an exit from the gate**: it is a **suspension**
in the closure ordering's sense, the floor, the Blocker/Major filter and the clean-final-pass
rule all stand, and what the answer does is stated there — what the stop prevents is a loop
committing you to a design you never chose, which is a different failure from an unfinished
review. **A change to this set costs the cycle at least one further pass.** The set a pass was
begun under is the set its closure would rely on, so the window opens **when that set is fixed
for the pass**, as this paragraph defines it, and runs to the closing act; a change anywhere in
that window costs a further pass, **in either direction and whether or not the change is later
undone**, the set having governed the pass differently while it stood. That further pass must
itself be clean and every other closure duty must be satisfied; it is one more pass, not a
licence to close on the next one.

**Recognizing "clearly stuck", so that exit is a reading and not a mood.** Read the
**Blocker curve across passes**, not any single pass's total — it is the better of the two
signals, the total says less than it looks like, and one low count is a snapshot rather
than a plateau. **Neither curve measures coverage:** a low Blocker count can sit beside an
entirely unreviewed subsystem. So this exit needs three things **together**, and a missing one means only that *this* exit does not apply — what the pass does instead is the closure ordering's, read there in full: a plateau
visible across passes (six or more is where the field saw one); an **affirmative judgement that
coverage is sufficient**, stated — a known materially unreviewed area forbids this exit outright,
and disclosing it does not license it; and **Blocker or Major findings that keep regenerating
across genuine repair attempts**, each round's fix producing the next — **or a finding the author
has validly dismissed that the reviewer re-raises across passes on the terms the closure ordering
sets**, a recurrence failing them being an ordinary fresh finding and not a re-raise at all, the
re-raise standing in for
the regenerating fix, since a dismissal gets no repair and produces none, and a reviewer returning
to the same refuted point every pass says the same thing about the loop that a fix producing the
next finding says. That third condition is what makes a plateau rather than a finish. **Where this reading and a clean
completion both apply, the closure ordering decides it** — the precedence sentence lives there,
because precedence is evaluation order.
**Surfacing does not close the cycle, and that is what makes this reachable.** You surface *with
the cycle and the new hold still open* — the resolve rule stands over the finding exactly as
Mechanics · Severity states it, **which scopes it to the assigned fix set**, so a recurrence of
one already validly dismissed **stays resolved on the terms the closure ordering sets** and owes
neither a second dismissal nor a repair, while a recurrence failing any of them is an ordinary
fresh finding;
the hold stands until
its answers are given, and **what the answer does is the closure ordering's**.
**A pass is credited clean or not on its own findings**, as that ordering defines cleanliness;
surfacing a finding that carries a scope-stop trigger is what withholds the credit, and no
credit is withheld for surfacing alone. Reading this as "stop instead of fixing" would put the
exit in competition with the rule that every **in-set** Blocker and Major resolves, and then
nothing could satisfy both.

**Every pass report states three things about the floor**, from pass 1 onward: the
derived floor, the risk and security values read, and the cited stories they were read
from. A report giving the number alone leaves a reader unable to check the derivation
while passes are still being spent — which is the only time checking it is cheap. Where
no story is cited, or a cited story is unprofiled, the report says so in place of axis
values; a multi-story set names each story and its values. This is owed by every pass;
the three lines below are owed from pass 4 and are a different obligation.

**From pass 4 onward every pass report carries three lines.** The carrier is **your own
status report to the user** — never the Codex reply, which stays exactly one line per branch,
and never the findings file, which admits no line that is not a finding or the terminator.
They are cheap because the numbers already exist: (1) the **trend** — findings and Blocker counts across the passes so
far; (2) where this pass's findings **cluster** — product behaviour, the test instrument, or
prose about either; (3) any **require↔withdraw pair** against earlier passes, meaning a pass
demanding what an earlier pass had removed.

Those three lines expose **five tells**: the finding count rising rather than falling; the
Blocker count failing to fall; findings clustering on the **instrument** rather than on
product behaviour; findings clustering on **prose about** either; and a require↔withdraw
pair. **Any two present makes stop-and-surface mandatory, not discretionary** — read **after** the
clean-completion branch of the closure ordering, which outranks it **by taking the pass to the
closing act and only then** — and you report the tells and hand the decision to the user, and the "clearly stuck"
reading above is not a precondition for it. A loop can be worth stopping long before it plateaus.

**What the answer does** is the closure ordering's, which is where this stop's place among the
suspensions and what its answer produces are both stated.

**The two rules above do not compete**, and neither overrides the other: the absorb rule
decides whether *a finding* is inside this loop's scope, this reading decides whether *the
loop* can still converge. A small correction-of-a-correction that stays inside the assigned fix
set is absorbed and is not by itself evidence of a plateau. Measured once, at the precision the record keeps: nineteen Gate-A
passes over successive revisions of one design spec past 2800 lines (the exact size is not
part of that evidence), findings from 43 into a 2–19 range after pass 6 and never zero,
Blockers from 11 to 0–1 from pass 7 on, and the late Blockers were semantic contradictions
rather than wording — which is why a low count is a signal to read and not a clearance.
Hence the sizing guidance: prefer **smaller specs with named interfaces** and let the plan
carry the detail — guidance, not a threshold, because where the plateau starts is
unmeasured.

**Findings go to a FILE, not the response — both gates.** Long finding lists come back
cut off, and a cut that lands between findings is indistinguishable from a short list:
silently dropped findings, the dangerous direction. Claude Code both limits MCP tool
output (25,000 tokens by default, `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`) and persists over-threshold
results to disk behind a file reference; the protocol below is correct under either,
because the response stops carrying the findings at all. Append to the gate prompt:

**Gate B takes one file per branch.** Under the default call shape each branch is its own sequential call writing its own slot, so no two reviewers write at once. `reviewType: full` runs the spec and quality reviewers in parallel from one `additionalContext`: aimed at a single path they race, and even with a path each, both reviewers have written both paths (PR #23) — the second writer leaves a correctly terminated, correctly counted file holding half the findings, with every check still passing. That race is `full`'s, and it is why `full` is not the default.

**Before each call, delete every target file and confirm it is gone.** A single-branch call's target is its own slot only: deleting the partner's slot before the second call would destroy the completed branch's file. A call that dies
part-way leaves the prior attempt's valid file behind, and no terminator can tell that
from a fresh one. If a target survives deletion, stop and name the cause — path resolved
against the wrong root, permissions, a *directory* at the target, or a file reappearing
(another writer) each need a different fix, and "delete failed" alone sends you retrying
the delete. Run one pass at a time: the slot name has no invocation-unique component, so
two concurrent calls on one slot race. Passes are sequential by construction, so that is
a stated limitation, not a guarded one.

**Optional companions, from field practice.** Two files may sit beside a findings file.
Both are advisory human notes: neither is ever the findings file, neither participates in
pass validation, and either may be deleted or rebuilt. The findings file plus its
terminator remain the only hard requirement, and a zero-finding pass needs no companion.

- `<slot>-dispositions.md` — one line per finding: verdict + reason. It makes a dismissal
  durable, so "we looked at that and why" outlives the session rather than the chat.
- a **cycle-stable** resume note when a cycle is interrupted — `gate-a-spec-resume.md`,
  `gate-a-plan-resume.md`, `gate-b-resume.md`. Cycle-stable, not pass-named: a note keyed
  to the interrupted pass number is exactly the file a resuming agent will not look for
  once the counter moves or an incomplete pass is discounted. Gate A runs separate spec
  and plan loops, so those are two cycles; Gate B is one cycle with one note even though each pass writes two branch files, because those files are written by Codex's reviewers, and race only under `reviewType: full` — the resume note is written by the outer agent, sequentially, and
  splitting it would create two records able to disagree about one shared recovery budget.
  Whoever runs the cycle writes it when useful, replaces it as the cycle moves, and
  deletes it once the cycle closes. Nothing depends on it existing.

**The cycle nonce.** Both shipped records below carry a **cycle field**, because a record that
cannot be attributed to a cycle cannot be told apart from another cycle's when several are read
together. That is a limitation rather than a disqualification — a human reading one cycle's
records knows which cycle they came from; what attribution buys is that a *later* reader
**usually** does not have to. Usually, not always: the guarantee is probabilistic, for the two
reasons stated at the end of this block. This section defines three **kinds** of cycle — the Gate-A spec loop, the Gate-A
plan loop and the Gate-B cycle — and **one cycle field is produced per cycle run, not per
kind**: a change carrying several plans runs a Gate-A plan cycle for each, and each of those is
its own cycle with its own nonce.

Generated once at cycle start, immutable, and collision-resistant operationally: **8 to 16
characters drawn uniformly from `[a-z0-9]`, from a source of randomness** — 8 being where
collision resistance starts and 16 where the field stops being a usable infix. **Never derived
from a name, a timestamp or a commit**, each of which collides exactly where sibling cycles do,
which is the one thing the nonce exists to prevent. The character set keeps it safe as a slot
infix and a path component.

**It appears in every record the cycle writes** — which keeps records apart **as far as distinct
nonces allow**, and no further — **and that set is named rather than left open**:
the provenance line, the per-pass curve (including a skip record standing in for one), the
cycle's findings slots, and its advisory working record. **The working record is a cycle record
too**: a cycle holding a nonce names it `gate-a-spec-<nonce>-resume.md`,
`gate-a-plan-<nonce>-resume.md` or `gate-b-<nonce>-resume.md`, and the bare names above stay
reserved for the legacy single-cycle case, exactly as the findings slots do. **Because recovery
scopes candidates by artifact as well as by kind, the record's contents name that artifact**, and
what counts as the artifact depends on the cycle kind: for a Gate-A cycle it is the reviewed
document's path, quoted by the same rule the provenance line uses where quoting is needed; for a
Gate-B cycle, which reviews a diff rather than a file, it is the **base commit's full
40-character hex object name**, the same value the cycle's reviews are run against. The filename
carries kind and nonce; the artifact key lives inside, where neither a path nor a hex name has to
survive a filename. The nonce is not
required in records this change neither introduces nor keys to a cycle — the evidence entry and
a human-exception record among them.

**A nonce is a candidate for recovery only if** it is keyed to this cycle's kind — Gate-A spec,
Gate-A plan, or Gate B — **and** this cycle's artifact, **and** that cycle is still open. **Those
three are necessary and not sufficient, and the difference matters**: two Gate-A cycles can review
the same document and two Gate-B cycles commonly share a base commit, so a sole match on kind and
artifact is **not** identity. **A candidate is adopted only if it is positively linked to this
run** — the working record this run itself wrote. A match that is merely consistent is treated as
no identity, and the cycle starts fresh; adopting a sibling on a shared key would merge two
cycles under one nonce, which is the failure this rule exists to prevent.
History normally holds many closed cycles' nonces and they are not candidates; a working record
left by a closed cycle is not one either, which is why that record is **retired at closure**
rather than left to be found later. **Recovery has two sources, and they answer different questions.** The **working record** is the
source while the cycle runs, and it is the one the candidate rules above apply to — several files
may be present and the run must decide which, if any, is its own. **History is the source once
the cycle's own commit exists**, and there is no search there: the cycle is reading **its own
commit body**, so kind and artifact are settled by which commit is being read, and the nonce is
taken from the provenance line and the curve, which must agree. A Gate-A cycle has such a commit only once its own closing commit exists — an already-committed
revision of the reviewed text is not one, carrying no provenance line and no curve for a nonce to
be taken from — so mid-run it has only the working record. Recovering a single candidate from
**either** keeps identity **as far as the field can distinguish cycles** — two cycles sharing a
nonce are one cycle to it. **No candidate,
disagreeing sources, or more than one candidate → no identity: start a new cycle**, which costs
passes rather than letting one cycle's records read as another's — again, as far as distinct
nonces allow. **Starting a new cycle does
not close, adopt or retire the cycles those candidates belong to** — they stay open, keep their
own nonces, and are a human's to resolve; the new cycle simply does not claim them.

**A cycle does not start without a valid nonce, unique among the cycles open when it was
generated.** That is the requirement. **What the check can establish is narrower** — it compares
against the cycles it can observe — and the gap between the two is the residual set out below.
Where generation fails, make **at most three attempts in total**, then stop and
surface, **naming which of the three causes occurred**; each has its own check and its own fix,
and one token would name a symptom rather than a cause:

The three are distinguished by **where** the attempt stopped, so they cannot both apply: the
source failed to produce bytes; or it produced bytes that are not a well-formed nonce; or it
produced a well-formed nonce that is already in use. An empty result is the first, never the
second.

- **randomness unavailable** — the source errors or produces no bytes. *Fix:* retry, since the
  condition can be transient; if it persists across the attempts, make a source available or run
  where one is, which is a change to the environment rather than another draw.
- **an invalid value** — the drawn value is not 8 to 16 characters from `[a-z0-9]`. *Fix:*
  redraw. Repeated invalid output points at the generator rather than at luck, and the report
  says which.
- **a collision with a known-open cycle** — the value equals a nonce on a cycle still open.
  *Fix:* redraw. A second collision at this width is possible but unlikely enough to be worth
  reporting as a possible source defect, which the report states as a suspicion rather than a
  finding.

**Report every distinct cause observed across the attempts, in the order they occurred** — the
attempts can fail for different reasons, and naming only the last would describe the tail of the
sequence rather than what happened.

**No deterministic fallback.**

**Residuals, disclosed rather than guarded, and this list is not exhaustive.** The check compares
against cycles *known to be open*, so a nonce can repeat one belonging to a cycle nobody can see;
two cycles starting at the same moment can each check before either has published, so neither
observes the other; and the check deliberately ignores **closed** cycles, so a new cycle can
redraw a closed one's value and then write to its surviving findings slots and working record.
**What makes both unlikely is the width of the draw, not the check** — and unlikely is the
honest word. Neither is a guard.

**What follows from that, said here rather than left to be discovered.** The nonce is
collision-**resistant**, not collision-**proof**, so everything built on it inherits that bound:
two cycles sharing a nonce write to the same slots and are not refused, their records read as
one cycle's, and a later reader cannot separate them. Attribution is therefore a strong default
rather than a guarantee, and any reading of these records that would be wrong if two cycles
shared a field should say so rather than assume they did not.

**A cycle that began before these rules shipped has no nonce and cannot acquire one.** Its
records carry the reserved `cycle none (pre-rule)` field and are, by construction, not
cycle-attributable. That exception is bounded and self-terminating: it reaches only cycles
already running when the rules land, and no later cycle can enter the state.


**Accept a pass only when** the file exists and is readable; its last line is exactly
`END OF FINDINGS (<n> total)`; it contains exactly `<n>` finding lines *and nothing
else* (or the single line `NO FINDINGS` when `<n>` is 0 — "n valid lines somewhere in
the file" would accept a truncated file padded with fragments); and, for a Gate-B pass, both branch files satisfy all of that. Anything else — missing, unreadable or
empty file, wrong path, malformed terminator, count mismatch, extra lines, one branch
file, an `INCOMPLETE` reply — is an **INCOMPLETE pass**, which is not a review: don't
act on the partial list, don't count it toward the floor, and don't read "no
Blocker/Major visible" as clean.

**Reader:** the severity field is taken by splitting the line on **unescaped** pipes and
trimming the ASCII whitespace the finding format puts either side of each separator; a field
that is empty or all whitespace is a **structural** failure, so the line is INCOMPLETE and is
never normalized. Otherwise the field is matched **case-insensitively** against the four tokens
first — `Minor`, `minor` and `MINOR` are all `MINOR`, because this file's Mechanics
legitimately spells them in Title case and a model copying that spelling is doing as it was
told, not drifting. A field that matches no token case-insensitively, and is non-empty, is
read as `MAJOR`. Every **structural** failure stays INCOMPLETE — a malformed
line, a wrong field count, an empty severity field, a bad terminator, a count mismatch. Only
the severity token is tolerated, and only when everything else about the line is right.
(PR #23's Gate-B pass 3 returned all four findings at `IMPORTANT`; discarding that pass over a
token would have thrown away four real findings.)

**Recovery: one attempt per pass**, shared across timeout, an `INCOMPLETE` reply and
failed validation — the Mechanics timeout-retry rule widened, not a second budget beside
it, since two budgets let a pass alternate between them indefinitely. The attempt is a
fresh re-run, deleting exactly what it will rewrite: both branch files for a full
re-run, only the failed branch for a single-branch resume — deleting both and recreating
one makes the both-files check fail by construction, spending the attempt on a path that
cannot succeed. Prefer a resume only when the reply shows the review ran and just the
write failed: pass the `sessionId` from the original tool result back, and for a Gate-B
branch pass its `reviewType` alongside (`spec` with `specSessionId`, `quality` with `qualitySessionId`), and the same `baseSha` and `headSha` as its partner branch, since the hook pairs a recovered branch with the waiting one only on those two exact values — the tool defaults to `full`, and a resume that omits it can run the
other reviewer and write the wrong slot, which no check detects, because the file is
well-formed and merely from the wrong branch. Whether a resumed session re-executes the
write or just returns its prior summary is not established; if it returns the summary,
that was the attempt. Spent and still incomplete → STOP and surface, naming which check
failed.

**What this does not do.** The hook counts on `PostToolUse`, keyed on tool name, **on the result envelope** and, for Gate B as of 0.21.0, **on the request**: a `spec` and a `quality` call on identical 40-character lowercase `baseSha` and `headSha` count as one pass, a `full` call or one with no `reviewType` as one — in both cases unless stale gate state the hook must remove first survives removal, which it names — and a lone branch, a `spec` or `quality` call with an unusable SHA, an unknown `reviewType` or a request it cannot read not at all (a `full` call is not checked for SHA usability). It still never sees the file. Claude Code fires `PostToolUse`
after a *successful* call and routes a failed one to `PostToolUseFailure`, which the
plugin registers no handler for — but do not infer from that which failures escape
counting: the pinned `mcp-codex-dev` catches its own errors, executor timeouts and aborts
included, and returns them as a normal result carrying `success: false` rather than
throwing or setting `isError`. A failed review therefore still looks like a successful
*tool call* — but as of 0.8.0 the hook reads the result of gate calls it can route, and
withholds the count for three **recognized** shapes: an envelope whose **first** property
is `success: false`, the harness backgrounding notice **in the wording it currently
uses**, and a result from which no usable text can be obtained. Every other routed gate call counts as the request rule above says, including any located text the hook cannot interpret — a reordered envelope,
a reworded notice, an unknown third-party shape — which counts **with** a disclosure that
is attempted and normally shown once per workspace, but can be lost or repeated when its
marker cannot be persisted. So does a call that returns and then fails validation. The
counter is therefore closer to the truth than it was and is still not evidence: a
"satisfied" count can still overstate the passes you actually hold, and reasoning about
which failure took which event path will get it wrong. The rule that follows is the
simple one: **discount every incomplete pass regardless of what the counter says**,
because classification cannot see whether the findings file was written.
Nothing checks the terminator mechanically; this is
instruction-backed by design, and a recurring truncation incident is the trigger to build
the checker, not a reason to build it now. Detection is conditional: it catches an absent
or malformed terminator, a count mismatch and a missing branch file *in the artifact you
actually read*; it does not catch a model that writes a wrong count with a matching
number of lines, nor a stale file if you skip the delete.

**Why `.context/codex-reviews/`:** the hook excludes `.context/` from all three of its
fingerprint components, so review artifacts cannot invalidate the review they document.
Add `/.context/codex-reviews/` to `.gitignore` — that entry specifically, not all of
`.context/`, which would strip the committed `codex-gate.on` adoption marker.

- **Gate A — Spec, then plan (TWO runs, each its own loop at the derived floor).** Run on the
  **spec** right after brainstorming (before `writing-plans`), then on the
  **plan** before `executing-plans`/`subagent-driven-development` — catching a
  spec flaw before it's baked into the plan. Tool: `mcp__codex__exec` (raw;
  reviews the TEXT you pass, not the git tree). Use ONE broad prompt: **its review question stays the same every pass, while the artifact text it
  carries and the dimensions it asks for are always the current ones** — the lens sets the profiles
  section derives are recomputed from the current profile and cited set each pass and appended, since
  a profile or cited-set change changes what is owed. Re-running it over an **unrevised** artifact
  is legitimate wherever no repair is owed, an edit made to justify a pass being no reason to run
  one. Don't narrow per-dimension: new findings surface because the artifact changed, because an
  answer given since the last pass changed what the rules require of it, or because a broad prompt
  reaches what the last reading did not. The prompt MUST open with
  *"Use the superpowers:brainstorming skill to review this spec,"* (say "plan" on
  the plan run), then ask Codex to check it against our settled decisions and
  surface **contradictions/inconsistencies, missing requirements, unhandled
  state/edge/error/empty/concurrent paths, and risks to the Key Invariants
  (@AGENTS.md) — plus anything else** (coverage floor, not a cage). Ask also what the artifact is for: of a spec, whether its
  commitments are coherent, sufficiently decided and feasible; of a plan, whether implementation can
  proceed — adequate decisions and dependencies, realistic steps, meaningful verification, and a clear
  line between local choices and questions that need a decision. Report missing code or tests only where
  their absence has a concrete consequence, and name that consequence; review code a plan does
  include like any other content. Why: a plan exists to settle decisions, and the code is written
  and checked in implementation. Append the
  intent + artifact text + which invariants it touches. Ask for **every** finding
  with severity and confidence — **you filter to Blocker/Major for what must be repaired and read
  every line for everything else**, Codex never filters, because a model told to report only high
  severity drops real findings silently.
  Ask for one line per finding and a literal `NO FINDINGS` when a pass found none — that explicit
  signal is what lets a pass be read as clean without inspecting it, and a pass carrying only Minors
  **and no scope-stop trigger** is clean too and could never produce that file:

  ```
  MAJOR | high | §3 "Retry policy" | retry count unbounded | a poisoned job loops forever | cap at 5, then dead-letter
  NO FINDINGS
  ```

  Each pass: validate, revise **where a repair is required**, and re-run **where the closure
  ordering selects its continue branch** — where it selects a suspension instead, the answer comes
  first and that ordering says what the answer produces. Before each read pass, settle mechanically what the
  artifact asserts and a machine can decide without side effects — cited paths, quoted
  passages, stated counts, the syntax of standalone fenced blocks — because a read pass
  spends expensive judgement on what a parser settles in seconds and misses it anyway,
  inspecting quoted commands rather than running them, since a command quoted in a spec
  may be destructive or an intentional failure. (Large/high-risk artifact: optional focused
  per-dimension passes on top.)
- **Gate B — Code.** Tests green, before `git commit`. Tool: `mcp__codex__review`
  (args `instruction`, `whatWasImplemented`, `baseSha`, `headSha`, `reviewType`). **Default call shape: two sequential single-branch calls per pass**, `reviewType: spec` then `reviewType: quality`, with the same `baseSha` and `headSha`, both resolved to full 40-character lowercase object names before the first call — the WIP-parent `baseSha` included; each call's `additionalContext` names only its own slot. `reviewType: full` runs both reviewers in parallel from one call; it stays accepted and counts as one pass, but its two reviewers can write each other's slots and the result passes every shape check, so it is not the default. Skip ONLY trivial changes. Check against
  @AGENTS.md. Re-review after every fix — a fix changes the artifact, so the prior
  review no longer covers it. The hook merely notices, at commit time.

  **A fix that changes specified behaviour updates the spec in the same commit.** If a
  Gate-B fix alters something the approved spec pins down — an ordering, a terminal
  state, a contract — the spec is stale the moment you commit, and the next reader
  trusts it. Update both, and let the re-review cover both. This is not hypothetical:
  a Gate-B fix here reordered a precedence rule and added a terminal state, the spec
  was left describing the old behaviour, and a PR bot found the disagreement after
  merge-readiness. Neither gate caught it *in that run*: Gate A had already passed the
  spec before the fix existed, and the Gate-B call was given only the diff. A reviewer
  handed both artifacts could catch it — which is why this is a rule about what you
  commit, not a claim about what the gates detect.

  Same coverage rule as Gate A: put "report every finding with severity and confidence; write
  `NO FINDINGS` only when the branch found none" in `additionalContext`, with the same one-line
  format. **You filter to Blocker/Major for what must be repaired, and read every line for
  everything else** — cleanliness, the scope triggers, the assigned fix set and the loop-health
  readings all take Minor and Nit lines. Codex never filters.

  **Standing lens, every Gate-B call: "which existing statements does this diff falsify?"**
  A change makes sentences wrong in files it never touches. Checks scoped to the edited
  paths — a parity diff, a resync, a grep of your own edits — do not look there, because
  the file was correct until your change landed elsewhere. This lens is prompt text: it
  asks, nothing enforces the ask or validates the answer, and no comprehensive check
  covers arbitrary semantic drift. Ask anyway; in practice it is what surfaces them.
  **Name what this diff changes the size, value or position of** — a list, a count, a
  version, an identifier, a cited line — and grep for where each is described elsewhere,
  because asked as an open question alone this lens missed three such statements in one
  cycle while being carried with unusual force.

  **What counts as prose (the only Gate-B exemption).** Every staged path is
  explanatory documentation — `docs/**.md`, `README.md` → N/A. Those describe the
  product rather than being it, so they carry no gate at all. **Prompts are not
  prose:** `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and anything under a `.claude/`, `plugins/`,
  `skills/` or `commands/` directory **at any depth**, are product even though they
  are `.md` — all fire full Gate B, as does any mixed commit or any non-`.md` file.
  Agent definitions are covered by that list, not listed separately: they live in
  `.claude/agents/` or `plugins/*/agents/`, both already matched. A bare top-level
  `agents/` is not matched, so do not add one and assume the gate sees it.
  The hook classifies paths the same way. Those directory names match at any depth
  deliberately, so a root-level `skills/` and a monorepo's `packages/*/.claude/` are
  both covered; the cost is that prose under a same-named directory
  (`docs/commands/reference.md`) fires too — a redundant reminder, never a missed
  review.

### Profiles — how much review this story gets

A story may carry a profile in its header: `**Risk:**` (`trivial|standard|high`),
`**Security:**` (`none|standard|high`), and a `**Validation:**` mode derived from them
(`battery` / `battery+check` / `battery+check+verification`, plus `+abuse-path` when and
only when security is `high`). The **story header is the single writable copy** — specs,
plans, commit bodies and this file's prompts carry the story **path** and read the values
fresh at each pass, never a remembered or copied value.

**The axes steer the questions; the mode steers the evidence.** Separate levers: one aims
the reviewer, the other obliges the author.

**Lens sets, appended to the gate prompt:**
- **risk `high`** → threats, abuse, rollback, data loss, idempotency, compatibility,
  observability.
- **security `standard` or `high`** → assets, trust boundaries, roles, external systems,
  abuse paths.
- **both** → the union appended **once**, each lens labelled with the axis that motivated
  it; risk's *abuse* and security's *abuse paths* are **one lens carrying both labels**,
  not two questions.

Lenses change what a pass asks, never how many a cycle owes: **the lens sets** leave every other
rule in this section alone.

**Reading the profile — five cases, five answers:**
0. **The ordinary case**: every cited story is readable and its profile resolves → derive the
   floor from it and run. Stated first because a partition of failures alone is not a
   partition, and an earlier revision of this list omitted it.
1. The artifact **cites no story** → run unprofiled and **say so** in the pass. Artifacts
   predating this rule are the common case; stopping on them would halt in-flight work.
2. The cited story has **no profile line** → same: today's behaviour.
3. The cited path **does not yield a readable story file** → **stop and surface which of
   these it was**, because each has a different fix: the path does not exist (a typo, or a
   file moved or deleted); it exists but is not a regular file, a directory being the common
   case; it is a symlink that does not resolve; or it exists and is a regular file but cannot
   be read for permissions. **Report what you observed; no test order is prescribed here**,
   because the obvious one is wrong — an ordinary existence or regular-file test follows a
   symlink, so a dangling link reads as absent rather than as a broken link.
   This case exists because none of the answers above is available to an agent that never
   obtained the file: it can establish neither that a profile is absent nor that one is
   present but unresolvable.
4. The story **is readable** and a profile is **present but unresolvable** → **stop and
   surface the cause**. That covers the syntactic failures — unparseable line, a value
   outside the enums, two profile blocks — **and the semantic ones**: a `**Validation:**`
   value disagreeing with `max(risk, security)`, or `+abuse-path` present without security
   `high` or absent with it. Only the **latest `mode override`** in the log, moving in a
   direction compatible with the current value, can explain such a mismatch — and if the
   log also contains an `axis change`, only when that override was recorded **after** the
   latest one, since an axis change voids every prior override. A log with no `axis
   change` at all is the ordinary intake-time override, and its entry resolves the
   mismatch on its own. A well-formed value can still be the wrong value, and a stale mode steers
   weaker evidence while looking entirely valid; recomputing it is a profile change like
   any other — proposed, human-confirmed, logged. Falling back to the lighter behaviour on
   a malformed profile would under-review exactly the stories most likely to have one.

**The Gate-B triviality skip needs two independent conditions**, and an eligible profile
never makes a behaviour-changing diff skippable: the change itself is **behaviourally
trivial** (the pre-existing judgement, unchanged by profiles), **and** for a profiled story
`max(risk, security)` is 0 — risk `trivial` *and* security `none`, never risk alone. The
**skip reason is recorded in the commit body** — not in the profile log, which records
profile *changes*, and a skip changes no profile value. **A skip removes the review, never
the evidence**, and what is owed follows the profile: a skipped **profiled** story runs the
battery and lands its evidence entry beside the reason; a skipped **unprofiled** story
records the reason and the battery result, because it owes no mode-derived entry and keeps
exactly today's judgement-based skip. **Neither is excused the records every cycle owes** —
the provenance line, and a skip record in place of the curve.

**A cycle citing several stories** aggregates along separate dimensions, never through one
winning mode: the **battery runs once** for the cycle; **each cited _profiled_ story
satisfies its own mode and suffix**, with its own named evidence entry, while a cited
**unprofiled** story has no mode and owes no entry; the **lens sets are unioned** across
all cited stories; and the cycle is skip-eligible only if **every** cited story is. A
single "max" would either under-serve the strictest story or impose its obligations on
unrelated ones.

**What the author owes before Gate B**, by mode: `battery` = the quality battery green ·
`battery+check` = battery + **a check that fails without the change** ·
`battery+check+verification` = battery + that check + a **named** verification of the risk
path · `+abuse-path` = one **named** abuse scenario plus evidence that the expected control
rejects or contains it. Level 2's two obligations are distinct; one artifact serves both
only if it demonstrates both.

A check need not be an automated test — where none is possible, a **named verification**
satisfies it and the entry says which route was taken and why. Either route owes the
**counterfactual**: the observation against the prior state. An **unobservable
counterfactual is a blocking evidence gap**, not a free pass — stop and surface; the human
may then lower the mode as a logged override. A fabricated test satisfies nothing. **Name
the observation that would exist if the claim were false, and confirm the wiring could have
produced it** — a check that supplies its own input, runs where the defect cannot appear, or
uses a fixture that never reaches the branch it covers reports success because of how it was
wired, not because the thing it checks succeeded.

**The evidence entry lives in the commit body** (see Mechanics), carries the **story path
and the named evidence but not the mode value**, and is **revalidated before every Gate-B re-review and before the commit its closing act
produces** — a fix changes the diff even when the profile sits still. If revalidation changes the entry, the pass was read against an entry that no longer stands: **fix the
entry and re-review on it**, and **which branch the pass takes meanwhile is the closure ordering's,
read there in full** — this paragraph states the repair and never the branch. The pass
that follows is read by that ordering like any other and closes only if it reaches closure, on the
entry revalidated for it.

**Every Gate-B call and re-review carries the path of every cited story**, so the reviewer
reads each profile itself, **plus the current evidence entry, quoted verbatim, for each
cited *profiled* story** — an unprofiled one owes no mode-derived evidence, so it
contributes a path and nothing else. One profiled story means one pair; a cycle citing
several carries all of them, because the reviewer cannot union lenses it cannot see or
judge evidence it was never given. A reviewer handed neither can only review the diff —
the lenses and the evidence obligations would exist and never be consumed.

**Two evidence gaps, two different answers.** Evidence that is *absent or inadequate* for
the mode is a **work gap**: produce it, then call. A project whose `AGENTS.md` names **no
verified quality command** cannot satisfy even `battery` — a **setup gap**: say what is
missing (`/workflow-init`'s battery step) rather than reviewing around it. Neither is a
reason to call Gate B against a weaker claim.

**Changing a profile:** the pass **proposes the complete resulting header** — both axes,
the recomputed mode, any renewed override — and the **human confirms it**, in both
directions; an agent never moves it alone. On confirmation, correct the header and append
one profile-log line. Any axis change **voids every prior override**, raised or lowered,
and `+abuse-path` follows the current security value. Passes already run under the lower
profile **keep counting** toward the floor; only the **final clean pass** must run under
the current profile. Inside an active Gate-B cycle, the edit must end up **in the content the next review reads** —
folded into the active `WIP:` snapshot by amend where that snapshot is the tip, and otherwise
reviewed as its own change, since no amend reaches a snapshot a stray commit has made an ancestor
and this section prescribes no operation that does. A non-`WIP` commit reads to the hook as the
cycle closing and would discard **the hook's count of** the accumulated passes.

**While a gate is running, the floor derives from the current profile at each pass.**
Passes already run keep counting; closing requires the floor as currently derived. These
are pass-count rules, so they apply while a gate is running and are silent otherwise —
what governs when a gate runs is unchanged and deliberately not summarised here.

**Any profile change costs at least one further pass**, in either direction and whether or
not the floor number moves, because the final clean pass must run under the current
profile — so no already-banked pass can be it. That further pass must itself be clean and
every other closure duty must be satisfied; it is one more pass, not a licence to close on
the next one. What a lowering drops is whatever the changed values drop, not a fixed pair:
a mode-only override changes the evidence obligations while leaving the axis-derived lens
sets alone, and security `high` → `standard` keeps the security lens set while changing
what evidence is owed. Every derived obligation is recomputed from the current profile.

**The cited set is re-read at each pass, and the final clean pass runs against the current
set** — whenever its membership changes, not only when the floor number moves. Adding a
high-risk story to a set already at floor 3 leaves the number alone while adding that
story's lens set, its evidence obligations and its review scope; a pass run before it
joined did not cover them. Removing a story recomputes obligations from the current set
and so does remove that story's lenses and evidence duty — but it never discharges an
accepted in-set Blocker or Major: the acceptance put that finding in the fix set, not the
citation.

**What this does not do:** nothing checks which file a model actually read, whether the
header changed mid-call, or whether the lens sets were appended. This is instruction-backed
like the rest of §5; the detection is a reader comparing the pass against the story.

### Mechanics (reference)
- **Severity:** Blocker (wrong/unsafe/breaks invariant) · Major (design flaw → rework) → both
  must resolve, **for every finding in the assigned fix set as the absorb paragraph computes it**.
  **A finding is resolved by a repair or by a validated dismissal** — the author's judgement,
  carrying the one-line why this section already requires, that the finding is not true of the
  artifact. A dismissal does not rewrite the pass that found it and the later clean pass is still
  owed; **a dismissal is not a decline**, a dismissal saying the finding is false and a decline
  being the user's decision that a **true** finding stays outside the set. Minor · Nit → collect;
  **their severity buys no repair round and no further pass.** Where accepting one into the
  assigned fix set costs a pass, that cost is the **set change's** and is stated at the absorb
  paragraph, not this severity's.

  **Deciding severity — one procedure. The subject list is illustration, not a second
  rule.** Name what in the system consumes this text — whatever *acts* on it — and the
  decision that act takes differently if the text is wrong. Both are required. If you cannot name both, the finding is Minor or below: collect; **its severity buys no repair
  round and no further pass**, and any pass a later scope decision costs is that decision's.

  The exclusions are contract, not commentary. The reader must consume the text in the
  system's *operation*, not in reviewing it — the review pass raising the finding is not
  an in-system reader of the text it reviews; without this the test demotes nothing.
  Gates remain legitimate readers of rule text they will later apply. A human reader never
  satisfies the test — the prose exemption already prices that cost as non-gating. The
  list of reader kinds is illustrative, not closed, because this ships into projects whose
  readers we have never seen. The test sets a ceiling, not a floor, and never chooses
  between Blocker and Major — the four definitions above still decide that. The instrument
  carve-out is symmetric: an instrument finding keeps its severity whenever it shows the
  instrument changes what a gate concludes about product behaviour — a false green, and
  equally a false red or a check blocking a valid change. Rationale prose is Minor only
  when no rule's application depends on it, not categorically: `docs/prompt-standards.md`
  requires rules to carry their why, so rationale a reader must consult to apply a rule
  passes the test. This removes arbitrariness, not judgement. Coverage-first is unchanged
  — the reviewer reports every finding with severity and confidence; the filter is ours.

  This is the finding-level analog of the path-level prose exemption: one principle at two
  granularities — text that *describes* the product versus text that *is* the product.

  **The demotion changes what a cycle must resolve, never what it observes.** **Every loop-health
  reading observes the findings as the reviewer produced them, before the ceiling is applied** —
  so a demoted finding still counts in the finding total and in its cluster, and a Blocker demoted
  to Minor is still a Blocker to the curve and still regeneration to the clearly-stuck reading's
  third condition. Where such a reading uses severity at all it takes the **reader-normalized
  pre-ceiling severity**, which is what the Reader paragraph above already produces from the
  findings file — case-folded, and a non-empty unrecognized token read as `MAJOR` — never the raw
  token, so a finding written `IMPORTANT` enters the curve as a Major. **The ceiling is applied
  after that and only to what the cycle owes**: cleanliness and the resolve duty read the
  effective severity, so the same finding can be a Major to the curve and a Minor **at effective
  severity**, and that difference is the point rather than a discrepancy. It stays in the fix set
  either way; the ceiling moves what the cycle owes for it and never whether it is in. The line is **what the cycle owes
  versus what it observes about itself**, which is why no list of readings has to be kept complete
  here. Two reasons for the split. The curve's **three numeric series** must stay derivable from
  the validated findings files alone wherever those files remain available — the rest of the curve
  is not and does not claim to be, its cycle field, pass ranges and model identifiers coming from
  elsewhere, and an unrecoverable count being written `?` exactly as the standing grammar allows —
  the finding total counts finding lines and the Blocker and Major series count the lines whose
  normalized severity is each, which is the only thing that makes a self-reported curve checkable;
  the subject clusters use no severity at all, being a judgement per finding that no count
  reproduces. And the demotion is the author's judgement about **the finding's repair severity**,
  never about which findings the fix set contains — a separate predicate the absorb paragraph
  defines, and one this must not be read as touching; a loop spending passes on findings the
  author keeps demoting is exactly what the prose-cluster tell exists to surface, and lowering the
  counts by that same judgement would hide it.
- **Tool routing:** docs (spec/plan, incl. code snippets) → `mcp__codex__exec`;
  implemented diff → `mcp__codex__review`. Never `review` a doc — it reads the
  git range, not the text.
- **`baseSha`:** against main = merge-base with main, passed as its full 40-character object name like `headSha`, since the hook pairs two branches only on two exact 40-character values (`headSha` = the full 40-character
  object name `HEAD` resolves to at that moment, never the symbolic `HEAD` — see the
  branch-agreement rule below for why);
  pre-commit, `baseSha` = HEAD is an empty range (HEAD..HEAD) — make a WIP commit
  and set `baseSha` to its parent. **Make that commit as `git commit -m 'WIP: …'`** — the
  recommended form, because the hook recognises a WIP commit from the command and the commit
  that results, not from the message alone. What it accepts is a one-line `git commit` with
  exactly one `-m` whose value starts with `wip` — single-quoted, double-quoted or bare; without
  `jq` the hook cannot attribute the result and resets — beside nothing but `-a`/`--all`,
  `-q`/`--quiet`, `-n`/`--no-verify`, `--amend` or `--allow-empty`; so no chain, `cd`,
  `git -C`, editor or `--fixup`, and none of `; & | < > $ ( )`, a backtick or a backslash
  anywhere, the message included. Beforehand, where a hook or setting in the repository could
  rewrite the message, it shows the ordinary Gate-B reminder instead of the WIP note.
  Afterwards it keeps your pass counters only if the resulting commit's subject starts with
  `wip` and `HEAD` moved by exactly this one commit since the command started — directly on
  the previous `HEAD`, or on its parent for `--amend`, with nothing else in between — or did
  not move at all, if the command failed; a commit run in the background resets. A
  plain `git commit --amend --no-edit` on a WIP commit counts too, under narrower conditions
  the dev-workflow CHANGELOG lists at 0.13.2. Any other commit the hook detects reads to it
  as a real commit — a snapshot named anything else, or made any other way: the hook treats the
  cycle as closed and **discards its count of the passes you just accumulated**, while the cycle
  itself stays open until the closure ordering's conditions hold. **What the hook loses is its counter state**, and that
  counter is not what makes a pass valid — so the reminder now understates what you hold, and no
  close was intended or made. **What such a commit does to the repository, and what the closing act
  then owes, is in the Gate-B closure paragraph**, not here.
  **Finishing the cycle:** **when a Gate-B cycle's closing act is performed is the closure
  ordering's, stated there entire**; this section gives only the operation. Close it with
  `git commit --amend -m "<real message>"`, which replaces the WIP commit; **where a `WIP:` snapshot
  would survive the amend** — several piled up, or a stray non-amending commit made one an
  ancestor — **`git reset --soft <parent-of-first-WIP>`, then commit once instead**. This section is the only
  place either shape is defined. **The hook treats any
  non-`WIP` commit *attempt* as a Gate-B boundary and clears its state even where the command
  fails**, so a failed closing act leaves that counter cleared — a fact about the
  counter and not about the cycle. This section states the operation and never whether the cycle may
  close. Amend rather than a
  follow-up commit for two reasons: a `WIP: …` commit left in history defeats the naming
  convention it exists for, and a follow-up commit has nothing to commit when the review
  produced no fixes.
  **The closing message carries the validated evidence entry for every cited profiled
  story** — one each, and none for a cited unprofiled story, which owes no entry. The
  amend replaces the WIP message wholesale, so an entry written only into the WIP body is
  destroyed exactly when the cycle closes. The final commit body is the durable record;
  a PR shows commit messages, so there is no second home to keep in sync.

  **Every cycle records one provenance line in its closing commit body** — default floor or
  not, so an absent line is never ambiguous between "the default applied" and "someone forgot".
  **One line per cycle**, so a change running five cycles records five. There is no informal
  variant; anything quoting this form elsewhere quotes an instance of it, because the deferred
  metrics work is intended to parse it — that consumer does not exist yet, and the form is pinned
  now so that it can.

  <CYCLE-FIELD>; floor <N> per <STORY-SET>; hook reminder threshold <KNOB>

  <CYCLE-FIELD> := "cycle " <NONCE> | "cycle none (pre-rule)"
  <NONCE>     := [a-z0-9]{8,16}
  <N>         := [1-9][0-9]*
  <STORY-SET> := "none" | "{" <ENTRY> ("," <ENTRY>)* "}"
                                            each <PATH> appears at most once; a repeated path,
                                            with or without conflicting levels, is malformed
  <ENTRY>     := <PATH> " (level " ("0"|"1"|"2") ")" | <PATH> " (unprofiled)"
  <PATH>      := <bare> | <quoted>
  <bare>      := [A-Za-z0-9._/-]+           contains no delimiter, quote or whitespace
  <quoted>    := a double-quoted string, non-empty, whose only escapes are \" and \\ ;
                                            a path containing a newline or other control
                                            character is NOT representable — the cycle stops
                                            and surfaces rather than emitting one
  <KNOB>      := "absent" | [1-9][0-9]* | "unusable"

  A filled instance, so the form is shown and not only described:

  cycle none (pre-rule); floor 3 per {docs/superpowers/stories/2026-08-28-review-loop-economics-pass-floor-story.md (level 2)}; hook reminder threshold absent

  It carries that cycle's **cycle field** — the nonce for any cycle started after these rules
  ship, `none (pre-rule)` only for one that began before them — the **derived floor**, and **the
  cited set that produced it**, each member with its level as a numeral. One floor and one set,
  not an entry per story, since unanimity makes the floor a property of the set. It
  distinguishes **a cited story with no profile** from **no story cited**. It records the
  **workspace knob whenever the file exists**: the value if the observer read one, otherwise
  `unusable`. **Nothing here describes what the hook does with that file, and the record does not
  say why a value was unusable** — four successive attempts to state either were each wrong in a
  different way, the last of them demonstrably so, and the rule for a claim needing a fourth
  correction is to delete it. Whoever needs to know why reads the file and the hook.

  **These rules and records are one contract, and a partial adoption breaks it.** The nonce, the
  slot naming, the provenance line, the curve, the carry rule, the unknown-start activation
  semantics **and the closure ordering together with every rule it reads** depend on one another,
  and the requirement is that the adopted definitions **agree**, not merely that all of them are
  present. **Membership is decided by a test a reader can apply to the text in front of them, with
  no list to consult, and the test reads what a rule states rather than what changing it would do:
  a live rule belongs to this contract when what it says **defines the validity of an input the
  closure ordering reads, or how that input is read**, which branch a pass takes, what a hold is or what discharges it, **what a suspension asks, or what state its answer or an
  incomplete closing act produces**, **what a gate's closing act is**, **which version of these rules
  governs a cycle**,
  whether a cycle may close **or may terminate without running a pass at all, the Gate-B triviality
  skip being the one such route and its eligibility test therefore a member**, or the production,
  identity or transport of **any §5 cycle record, required or optional** — §5 entire and not the
  Mechanics subsection this paragraph sits in, record duties being stated in both, and the optional
  companions' slot rules carrying the nonce that keeps sibling cycles apart.** **Read it on the sentence, never on the section the sentence sits in.**
  A sentence is a member when **it itself** fixes one of those things — what counts as a valid
  finding line, which files or records are owed, what ends a hold. It is not a member when it only
  shapes what a review produces, as the choice of reviewer, the lens set and **prompt wording that only frames the
  review question** do: those change the findings without deciding what a finding *is* or what the
  ordering may do with one. **Prompt wording that fixes a valid input is a member**, the gate-prompt
  sentences defining a finding line and the `NO FINDINGS` signal being exactly that. **No paragraph is exempt as a paragraph** — a sentence inside a routing or prompt paragraph
  that fixes a valid input or an owed file is a member, and a sentence anywhere that only influences
  the findings is not. The examples follow the test; they do not stand in for it.
  Asking instead what an imagined edit would do decides nothing, because
  any rule can be edited into deciding a branch and none decides one when edited cosmetically, so
  membership would follow the edit a reader pictured rather than the text in front of them. The
  last clause is why the squash carry belongs: it moves no pass and
  decides no branch, and a record that does not survive the merge is unreachable from the squash
  commit and from `main`'s history. A curve without a cycle field cannot be reliably told from
  another cycle's in every multi-cycle context — kind and surrounding context sometimes separate
  them, which is why the standing rule calls missing attribution a limitation rather than a
  disqualification — a slot rule without a nonce cannot keep sibling cycles
  apart — the bare names staying reserved for the legacy single-cycle case they already serve — a
  carry rule naming records a project does not produce is inert, and a clean predicate without the
  fix-set boundary it reads decides membership by accident.
  **A project whose text carries some of them and not others, or carries all of them in versions
  that disagree, stops and has a human complete, revert or reconcile the adoption before running a
  gate under it.** **The test classifies sentences that are present, and completeness is not among
  what it establishes**: where an adoption drops a member together with every sentence that would
  refer to it, what remains reads as coherent and nothing in it marks the absence. **That bounds
  what this text lets a reader detect, never what the rule obliges** — a partial adoption is a stop
  however it becomes known, and learning of it from outside this text is learning of it.

  **On squash-merge, copy every evidence entry, every human-exception record, the provenance lines, the curves and any skipped cycle's skip record TOGETHER WITH THE SKIP REASON IT POINTS AT in the squash range into the squash body — a skip record carried without its reason is a pointer into a body the squash has made unreachable — the squash commit is the only body the merge carries into `main`'s history, so anything left behind is unreachable from it.**

  **Every cycle records its own per-pass curve in its own commit body.** Gate B alone would
  leave the dominant cost unrecorded — the loops this rule was built from are Gate-A loops.

  <CYCLE-FIELD>; <CYCLE> (passes <SPEC>, <MODELS>): Findings <COUNTS>. Blockers <COUNTS>. Majors <COUNTS>.

  <CYCLE>    := "Gate-A spec" | "Gate-A plan" | "Gate B"
  <SPEC>     := <RANGE> ("," <RANGE>)*      strictly ascending, non-overlapping
  <RANGE>    := <p> | <p> "-" <p>
  <p>        := [1-9][0-9]*
  <COUNTS>   := <n> ("," <n>)*              exactly as many entries as <SPEC> enumerates
  <n>        := 0 | [1-9][0-9]* | "?"      "?" = the count is unrecoverable for that pass
  <MODELS>   := <model> | <PER-PASS> ("; " <PER-PASS>)*
  <PER-PASS> := "pass " <p> " " <model> ("+" <model>)*
  <model>    := <bare-model> | <quoted-model> | "undetermined"
                                            "undetermined" means the model could not be determined;
                                            a real model so named is written as <quoted-model>
  <bare-model> := [!-~]{1,} minus ; : , ( ) + " and space, and not the
                                            literal "undetermined", which is reserved
                                            printable ASCII only; a control character makes the
                                            identifier unrepresentable, handled below
  <quoted-model> := a non-empty double-quoted string, same two escapes as <quoted>;
                                            an identifier that cannot be determined, or cannot be
                                            represented, is written `undetermined`, and the raw
                                            value is NOT reproduced anywhere in the body, since a
                                            commit message cannot safely carry one (NUL cannot
                                            appear at all). The record does not say why a pass
                                            reached `undetermined`, and nothing here describes how
                                            a model identifier fails — same rule, same reason as
                                            the knob above

  Two filled instances, one ordinary and one with a split logical pass:

  cycle none (pre-rule); Gate B (passes 1-3, codex): Findings 16,29,4. Blockers 4,15,0. Majors 5,2,1.
  cycle 7b2q9xk4; Gate-A spec (passes 1,2, pass 1 codex+claude; pass 2 codex): Findings 5,0. Blockers 1,0. Majors 2,0.

  A skipped cycle writes `<CYCLE-FIELD>; <CYCLE>: skipped (see skip reason)` and no counts. **The skip
  reason it points at is the text immediately following it in the same commit body** —
  adjacency is the link. The cycle field is not: every pre-rule cycle writes
  `cycle none (pre-rule)`, so it identifies nothing when a body carries more than one.
  **`<PER-PASS>` keys must be exactly the passes `<SPEC>` expands to, each once, ascending** — a
  list that omits or repeats a pass is malformed, not partially informative — and **every model
  contributing to a split logical pass is listed**, joined by `+`, since recording one of two is
  the same loss as recording none.

  **Majors are recorded as well as Findings and Blockers**, because the three series are read
  before the ceiling and the mix among them is what a later reader compares; the ceiling moves what
  a cycle owes and leaves these counts alone, so totals and Blockers alone could not show even a
  change in the mix. **Subject categories are deliberately not recorded** — they are a judgement
  per finding rather than a count, and the findings files carry the material.

  **One entry per valid pass**, and since incomplete passes are excluded while still consuming
  pass numbers, the record **states which pass numbers it covers**. A valid zero-finding pass is
  recorded as zero, never omitted. **A count that cannot be recovered is written `?`, never
  guessed and never written as `0`** — a cycle keeps its identity through the nonce rather than
  through its pass files, as far as distinct nonces allow, so a resumed cycle may know a pass happened and not what it found, and
  zero and unknown are different facts. **`?` is per series**: a pass whose Findings are unknown
  may still have usable Blocker and Major counts, and a reader excludes the unknown value from
  the comparisons that read that series while keeping the pass's other series.

  A `full` Gate-B pass, separate `spec`/`quality` calls, and a single-branch recovery are
  **branches of one logical pass** contributing one summed entry — **the curve counts logical passes; the hook counts a `full` call or a matched `spec`+`quality` pair as one pass and a lone branch as none**, so the two agree for those shapes, and where they differ — a recovery re-run, a call the hook could not read — the body says so **as prose beside the
  curve**: neither grammar has a field for a call count, deliberately, since the count is a
  property of how the pass was invoked rather than of what it found. **Both branches must be
  issued against the same commit**, and that — not what they read — is what this rule
  establishes. The result reports no reviewed revision, so there is nothing to read back and no
  way to confirm from the reply what either branch actually looked at. What is available is the
  request: **resolve `HEAD` to its full 40-character object name before each call and pass that
  explicit value as `headSha`**, never the symbolic `HEAD`, which two calls can resolve
  differently if a `WIP:` amend lands between them. Keep the value you passed **with that
  branch's result**, and require the two kept values — **`baseSha` and `headSha` both**, since a
  range is selected by both ends and two calls can share a head over different bases — to be
  **exactly equal** before summing the branches. Equal values mean the two calls were aimed at one commit; they are not evidence that
  either branch reviewed it, and nothing available here would be. Record it as the **full 40-character hex object name**, since abbreviations are
  ambiguous across repositories and across time; if it changed between them they are not one
  pass, the completed branch is recorded as incomplete and excluded, and the later branch begins
  a new one. Ending the pass is the conservative direction; merging two revisions would produce
  one entry describing two different artifacts.

  **What the curve is worth, stated rather than implied.** Durable **across** cycles; **not
  within** a running one, since the commit does not exist until the cycle closes. And
  **author-written and unchecked** — nothing compares it against the validated pass files, so
  whatever reads it reads a self-reported curve and must not present it as measurement.

  **Recording a human exception.** Where a human decides that something **no applicable rule
  required** was nonetheless worth skipping — an optional check this environment cannot run, a
  review someone asked for and then stood down, a courtesy step — that decision goes in the
  closing commit body:

  ```
  Human exception: <handle> · <date>
  Not done: <what was skipped, specifically>
  Accepted because: <one line>
  ```

  **Which commit:** an ungated change records it in that commit; a Gate-A cycle in the commit its
  closing act uses; a Gate-B cycle in the WIP commit, restated by the commit its closing act
  produces. Several records
  accumulate; order means nothing.

  **A decision made after its commit closed** — during PR review, say — goes in whichever of
  these exists: the next commit on the branch, the squash body, or a follow-up commit after the
  merge. If none does — the branch is closed, unmerged, and heading for an ordinary or rebase
  merge — **add a commit for it.** An empty commit carrying only the record is a legitimate
  destination: it changes no content, so it raises no review obligation. A record with nowhere
  to go would otherwise be a record that does not exist.

  **Do not expect silence from the gate hook, and do not read a reminder as a gate
  reopening.** It is advisory, so it never blocks the commit attempt. What is exempt is the
  **empty diff**, which `git show --stat` confirms — never a reminder that merely looks the
  same on a commit carrying content.

  Copy every record into the squash body alongside the evidence entry (Mechanics,
  squash-merge carry). **Nothing performs that carry and nothing checks afterwards that it
  happened** — it is on whoever prepares the merge. If two copies of one record disagree, that
  is a copying error: stop and fix it rather than picking one.

  **Scope, and it is narrow. This form supplies no permission.** It records a decision that
  was already the human's to make about something genuinely optional. It is **never** the answer to a
  below-floor pass, an unclean final pass, a `STOP and surface`, a Gate-A or Gate-B
  obligation, or a profile-derived evidence requirement — and more generally **it authorizes
  nothing that any mandatory rule in this file, in `CLAUDE.md` or in `AGENTS.md` requires.** Those have their own terminal actions and this paragraph changes none of them: on a STOP you
  still stop, and **neither a human's general assent nor this record** lets an agent close or
  continue a cycle. **The answers a suspension asks for are not assent of that kind**: they are the
  answers the closure ordering prescribes, and both which answers those are and what they produce are
  stated there.

  **"Mandatory" is not limited to these files.** A rule in `AGENTS.md`, a project doc, CI, a
  branch policy or the platform is equally out of reach — under **Wait for**,
  `docs/pr-review-bots.md` requires a bot review unless an explicit recorded human decision
  permits proceeding without it, and this form is not that decision. If you are reaching for it to get past something mandatory, the answer
  is no — take the operational route or stop.

  **Nor is it for things that were simply never owed.** An absent review from a bot routed
  **opportunistically** blocks nothing and needs no exception and no record;
  `docs/pr-review-bots.md` says so deliberately, and writing one anyway would rebuild the
  per-quiet-bot ceremony that routing removed. Record a decision, not a non-event.

  **What the record is worth.** It is an **unverified assertion**, and reads as one: nothing
  checks that the handle belongs to whoever decided, that a human was asked, or that the
  reason is honest. A reader of history learns that *the commit claims* a human chose, what
  it says was skipped, and why — no more. It supports no claim of authorization or review,
  and satisfies no evidence obligation. It exists because an exception nobody wrote down is
  invisible, not because writing it down makes it sound.
- **Timeout / abort:** a codex call that dies at the MCP tool-call timeout is retried
  once before surfacing to the user, and that retry *is* the single shared recovery
  attempt above — not a second one. An abort is an incomplete pass, so treat it as one:
  it may have left a partial or stale target file, so delete the targets and confirm them
  gone before retrying, then validate the result like any other pass. Whether it moved the
  hook's counter depends on the shape it returned and on which hook version is installed:
  as of 0.8.0 a recognized failure envelope, the recognized backgrounding notice and a
  result yielding no usable text are all withheld from the count, while a reordered,
  reworded or unrecognized shape is still admitted fail-open — and as of 0.21.0 an admitted
  call is credited only as a `full` call or a completed pair, by the request rule above. Do
  not reason from the counter
  either way — an incomplete pass is discounted whatever it says. Counter and workspace
  state persist in `.context/`; the *pass* does not.
